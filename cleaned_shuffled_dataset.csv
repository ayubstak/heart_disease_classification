4,i think there a fundamental misunderstanding here beta blockers such as propranolol act by blocking beta 1 and beta 2 receptors throughout the body beta 1 receptors when stimulated cause an increase in heart rate among other effects beta 2 receptors when stimulated cause whole bunch of other things such as vasodilation relaxation of blood vessels relax bronchioles etc now beta blockers are usually given to someone in heart failure or with atrial fibrillation in these states the heart is working to hard at rest and is doing damage to itself because of this work because it is working so hard it is becoming ischemic lack of oxygen and other nutrients beta blockers block beta receptors and cause the resting heart rate to decrease this causes the heart to not work as hard at rest which increases the survival for people with these conditions now beta blockers block certain amount of beta adrenergic stimulation but not all of it that would be very dangerous so when you exercise even if you are taking your beta blockers there is such flood of acetylcholine the molecule that stimulates beta blockers that it can bind to receptors even in the presence of the drug and cause an increase in heart rate therefore even if you are on the drug you still get increases in heart rate with higher than normal levels of stimulation ,no

21,have to page through 9 slides 8 rheumatoid arthritis medication side effects by chris iliades md reviewed by farrokh sohrabi md minimizing the risks of rheumatoid arthritis treatment although there a range of drugs that can treat rheumatoid arthritis ra they can all have significant side effects some are common and some not so common says diane horowitz md an assistant professor of rheumatology at the hofstra north shore lij school of medicine in hempstead new york whether you re taking steroids or non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids to control your symptoms or using disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs dmards to manage your ra condition you and your doctor should discuss any potential side effects that can occur during your treatment here are eight ra medication side effects to be aware of nsaids and stomach problems nsaids which block the inflammation of ra can be present in both prescription drugs and over the counter drugs like ibuprofen the most common side effects are stomach problems like heartburn and belching but you can minimize these risks by taking the medication with food and just remember once you start ra management nsaid use should be only for add on symptom relief says matthew husa md rheumatologist and assistant professor in the division of rheumatology and immunology at the ohio state medical center in columbus nsaids and bleeding using nsaids can irritate the lining of your stomach which can then lead to bleeding and unfortunately taking the medication with food might not help if you are frequently taking over the counter nsaids you need to let your doctor know says dr horowitz your provider might be able to give you medication that will reduce your risk of bleeding while taking nsaids and in the meantime you can further cut your risk by avoiding alcohol steroids and toxicity steroids in ra management get symptoms under control quickly but they may also cause high blood pressure weight gain high blood sugar and decreased bone health that one reason they re better short term solution steroids can be used for while until dmards kick in dr husa says they are guaranteed to be toxic if you use them too long by limiting your exposure your doctor can help protect you from steroid side effects methotrexate fog trexall methotrexate is usually the first dmard used for ra management methotrexate does more than relieve symptoms it also slows down the disease states the johns hopkins arthritis center it is given once week as an injection or can be taken in pill form common side effects include nausea headaches fatigue and feeling wiped out almost as if you re in fog but by taking methotrexate at night you may be able to minimize these problems likewise you can avoid feeling nauseous if you opt for the injection under the skin taking folic acid b vitamin along with methotrexate may also help limit side effects horowitz says methotrexate liver damage the most serious side effect of methotrexate is liver damage that why people with existing liver disease aren good candidates for this medication according to the johns hopkins arthritis center you should have your liver checked with blood test when you start methotrexate and about every two months while you are taking it husa says to avoid liver damage while taking the medication limit alcoholic drinks to maximum of one or two per week triple therapy and eye damage combining methotrexate with two other dmards may be an option if methotrexate alone isn enough to achieve good ra management according to johns hopkins one of the drugs used in this triple therapy is hydroxychloroquine malaria drug that effective for some cases of ra for this particular dmard the most serious possible side effect is eye damage although you should have an eye exam by an eye specialist within six months of starting this drug and be rechecked at regular intervals recommended by your rheumatologist you should tell your doctor immediately if you start having eye pain sensitivity to light or vision changes says horowitz biologic drugs and infection biologic drugs are the newest addition to ra management your doctor may recommend one of these drugs if older dmards are not helping the biggest worry with biologics is an increased risk of infection horowitz says before you begin treatment with biologic drugs your doctor is likely to test you for tuberculosis and hepatitis because biologics weaken your immune system and could reactivate those infections and if you have another active infection your doctor may want to wait until you recover once you begin using biologics wash your hands frequently avoid people who are sick and tell your doctor if you develop cough fever or symptoms of cold biologic drugs and other issues there are rare reports that biologic drugs can possibly increase the risk for some cancers psoriasis multiple sclerosis and heart failure husa says but the research is still inconclusive in any case the benefits of biologic outweigh these risks husa says your best defense against all ra medication side effects is to be informed and follow all your doctor instructions carefully http www everydayhealth com pictures ra medication

23,aarhus university many danes are prescribed nsaids for the treatment of painful conditions fever and inflammation but the treatment also comes with side effects including the risk of ulcers and increased blood pressure major new study now gathers all research in the area this shows that arthritis medicine is particularly dangerous for heart patients and also that older types of arthritis medicine which have not previously been in focus also appear to be dangerous for the heart it been well known for number of years that newer types of nsaids what are known as cox 2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attacks for this reason number of these newer types of nsaids have been taken off the market again we can now see that some of the older nsaid types particularly diclofenac are also associated with an increased risk of heart attack and apparently to the same extent as several of the types that were taken off the market says morten schmidt md and phd from aarhus university who is in charge of the research project he adds this is worrying because these older types of medicine are frequently used throughout the western world and in many countries available without prescription each year more than 15 per cent of the western countries collects prescription for nsaids this figure increases with age sixty per cent of the adult population in denmark collects at least one prescription for an nsaid within ten year period heart patients are no exception and previous studies have shown that up to forty per cent of danish patients with heart failure or previous heart attacks are prescribed nsaids the study which was carried out in collaboration between 14 european universities and hospitals including number of leading european heart specialists is today being published in the most prestigious european journal of heart medicine european heart journal new guidelines in the study the researchers have gathered all research on the use of nsaids in patients with heart disease the survey means that the european society of cardiology has now for the first time formulated number of recommendations about what doctors should consider before prescribing painkillers to their patients when doctors issue prescriptions for nsaids they must in each individual case carry out thorough assessment of the risk of heart complications and bleeding nsaids should only be sold over the counter when it comes with an adequate warning about the associated cardiovascular risks in general nsaids are not be used in patients who have or are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases says another of the authors professor in cardiology christian torp pedersen aalborg university denmark consumption should be reduced even more for number of years danish researchers have made significant contributions in the field one result of this work has been reduction in the use of diclofenac in denmark however according to morten schmidt there is still room for improvement many european countries consume more of these drugs than denmark but we can still do better and it often the case that paracetamol physiotherapy mild opioids or other types of nsaids with less risk for the heart would be better for the patients of course the recommendations that have been introduced following our study and its review of the heart related risks are big step in the right direction in relation to patient safety says morten schmidt facts about arthritis medicine nsaid nsaids is an abbreviation for nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and is used to treat wide range of diseases in particular disorders in the muscular and bone system where the drug counteracts swelling pain and limitations in movement associated with inflammation nsaids are not antibiotics and therefore do not help to fight infections caused by bacteria nsaids are in denmark sold both in low doses ibuprofen 200 mg tablet without prescription and in higher doses and other types with prescription read the scientific article http eurheartj oxfordjournals org content early 2015 09 27 eurheartj ehv505 contact information aarhus university and aarhus university hospital department of clinical epidemiology london school of hygiene tropical medicine non communicable disease epidemiology telephone 44 7469799789,no

heart you will see rapid improvements in your breathing mood and reduce your risk of stroke diabetes cancer circulation problems and numerous other problems watch your weight the association between heart disease and being overweight is extremely strong not least because obesity puts you at risk of type 2 diabetes which in itself increases the risk of heart disease and multiple other conditions if you carry more weight around your waist than your hips you are even more at risk to calculate your waist to hip ratio divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement high ratio over 0 85 for women or 1 for men means increased risk of health problems such as heart attacks high blood pressure or diabetes even if you aren that overweight the link between heart disease and weight is extremely strong not least because obesity increases person risk of type 2 diabetes which in itself increases the risk of heart disease 3 is fat free best you have probably been advised to cut out saturated fats and replace butter with unsaturated fat spreads this is because diet high in saturated fats is thought to be one factor that leads to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood which in turn may cause narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks however there is now some controversy as to whether these dietary changes make much difference to your risk of heart disease recent overview of multiple studies found no evidence that restricting saturated fat and increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption lowered the risk of developing heart disease the jury is still out on this one and it shouldn be used as an excuse to eat high fat doughnuts pastries chips and other sources of processed saturated fat however butter cheese and cream in small quantities may not be the complete villains they were thought to be 4 say bye bye to bacon reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown that eating large amount can increase heart failure by up to 24 per cent however recent evidence suggests that this is linked more to red meat that is processed we re talking ham salami sausages bacon etc with no definite association shown with the consumption of unprocessed red meat the researchers calculated that for each 50g of processed meat eaten per day about one or two extra slices of ham the risk of heart failure increased by eight per cent and the risk of death by 38 per cent these results require confirmation with further studies but as processing can increase the risk of stomach disease too it seems sensible to limit processed red meat wherever possible reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown eating large quantities can increase heart failure by up to 24 per cent but recent evidence suggests this link is more pertinent with processed meats such as bacon salami sausages and ham 5 eat less salt the british heart foundation is clear that too much salt can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease later in life adults should have less than six grams one teaspoon day cutting back on salt doesn just mean keeping your hands away from the salt cellar when you are eating there is also lot of hidden salt in processed food check the labels and cook from scratch wherever possible then you are in control 6 say no to sugar large population study in the united states showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had an almost three times higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had less than 10 per cent independent of other risk factors including weight more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic too and as it offers no nutrients whatsoever it is time to cut back gradually reduce the sugar you add to your food or drinks avoid fizzy drinks and look carefully at labels you will be amazed at how much sugar is added to all sorts of food both sweet and savoury study in the us showed people who consume more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had an almost three times higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had less than 10 per cent of calories from added sugar 7 keep active don despair if you are couch potato it never too late to start as well as helping with that weight loss recent study showed that you could get the same heart health benefits if starting exercise such as running or cycling after 40 as you would have done if you had started before the age of 30 there are numerous other benefits from exercise too what are you waiting for 8 stress less and finally while you should be aware of keeping your heart healthy don let it stress you out as stress doesn help your heart either the stress hormone cortisol can increase unhealthy fat around the middle raising your risk of heart problems as well as leading to cravings for high fat and sugar foods which only make things worse so for healthy and happy heart start making few small changes today your heart will love you forever it is vital to keep active if you want to sustain good heart health but couch potatoes do not have to despair for it is never too late to start studies suggest recent evidence shows you get the same heart health benefits of starting exercise after 40 as you would have done had you started in your 30s,no

56,yes people are right beta blockers have been relegated to second line therapies when they assess drugs tehy look at number of things the most obvious is how effective they are and side effects but they also look at what they call endpoints these include the adverse health effects of high blood pressure like strokes heart attacks kidney failure heart failure and of course death so drug might lower the bp but have no effect on the endpoints generally drugs like ccb ace inhibitors arb and some diuretics tend to have much more of an effect on preventing or even treating some of these endpoints ccb are best when hypertension is due to arterial resistance due to stiffness of the arterial walls which naturally increases with age and is more common in afro caribeans there are other issues about the ways the drugs work or how they might be combined that also influence the dr choices hope this makes sense ,no

63,a little more than year ago my colleagues and started the streetcred police killings in context data project there were already several projects tracking police shootings including fatal encounters and new projects at the washington post and the guardian but we felt that they left out crucial context why did the police become involved in these incidents in the first place was their use of force something that most people would consider reasonable such as the police response after mohammad youssef abdulazeez opened fire on military personnel at chattanooga tenn recruiting station or was it unreasonable as with the shameful killing of walter scott the most common criticism received was that it was an attempt to demonstrate that police aren the problem m white texas cop so that not an unreasonable presumption but hope you ll see that what we found can steer the conversation toward more productive and meaningful reforms we began as others did with the fatal encounters database where the post pulitzer prize winning effort focused on police shootings we focused on all police related deaths and where the guardian included killings by for example prison guards or traffic accidents or personal disputes between officers we focused only on official acts on or off duty by police officers ultimately we gathered more than 70 contextual data points from the mundane middle name to the specific if the person was listed as mentally ill was it previously diagnosed serious mental illness or merely suspected we eventually identified 153 cases in which unarmed civilians had died after an encounter with police in 2015 we now had wealth of contextual data that we believed could add lot to the ongoing dialogue about police shootings we think the context for these shootings transcends both race and politics we have assembled our findings in book in context understanding police killings of unarmed civilians which we believe is instructive for activists police officers and use of force trainers the context behind these shootings can also help readers understand how police and trainers approach these cases and the applicable law they use to determine when different levels of force are justified we tried to be objective but true objectivity is of course impossible everyone has inherent bias instead we ve tried to be as open and transparent as we can we included more than 500 source footnotes in the book as well as an open update system to track when we got something wrong the data methodology and schema on which we based our conclusions are all open and available under the creative commons share alike license so please feel free to check our work from my interpretation of the data there are some relatively easy changes police and policymakers can make that will go long way toward improving policing in the united states here are what you might call the low hanging fruit police must release more data and do it sooner when agencies delay public suspicion and speculation fill the void every time police choose transparency it a deposit in the bank of goodwill it builds community trust las vegas has shown that police department can be transparent and forthcoming after police shooting without disrupting the integrity of the investigation honesty begins with timely release of the earliest available information that might include timeline recordings of 911 calls narrative and any video without video or 911 calls the public has nothing but the word of the police and as we have seen police do sometimes lie not always not even lot according to our research but consider the walter scott shooting and the apparent lies told by officer michael slager high profile case like that can quickly make citizens lose faith in the system sunlight is the best disinfectant while the media and activists groups often focus on race the data show greater disparity in deadly engagements with drug addicts and the mentally ill in 2015 nearly half 46 percent of the deaths of unarmed civilians after police encounter involved someone suffering from serious mental illness overdosing on drugs or both we tend to think of both mental health and drug addiction to be issues at the margins of society these issues need far more social legal and policy attention than they re getting one approach gaining popularity is the memphis model crisis intervention team cit for first responders under the cit model police officers are trained how to recognize the symptoms of mental illness crisis how to communicate with people experiencing mental health crisis and how to intervene without escalating the model has been widely praised and should continue to be adopted around the country but it is clear that the problem is bigger than just crisis management the work needs to start before mentally ill person goes into crisis in the first place we re also seeing new programs to address that problem with promising results program in the mid cities between dallas and fort worth for example has been successful in training cops on new ways to liaise with the mentally ill by focusing on wellness checks in addition to crisis management the area has seen reduction in acute mental health crisis hospitalizations such creative programs stress regular visits and include outreach to friends and family it a really smart way to work it saves lives and money and arguably makes the community more strongly supportive of all its residents many state police academies have also been adding more training in mental health and disability in my opinion we need more of these programs and with an even broader focus but even with new training we must remember that the police should be the last line of defense from mentally ill people who potentially pose threat to the community instead police are too often the first the federal government has long passed the buck on mental health to the states under both democratic and republican administrations state governments have also dropped the ball mental illness is society wide issue it can just be police issue the buck can be passed down but cops can pass the buck back up and if we are going to insist on asking cops to respond to mental health crises the least we can do is give them the proper training and support look at all disability not just mental illness when we add physical disability such as pulmonary emphysema enlarged heart hypertensive or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease thyroid disorder to that statistic the number of unarmed citizens who died after police encounter suffering from drugs mental illness and or physical disability is 52 percent that of course is more than half we need to consider as society the effects our national health care policies can have on policing we also need to be make sure police are properly trained to interact with people with disabilities such as deafness or autism health care and policing aren unrelated issues cops alone can change this it should be part of the larger conversation among activists health care professionals journalists and law enforcement leaders while it true that fixing the american health care system isn exactly low hanging fruit one fix that would go long way is better coordination among police health care providers and advocacy groups for people with disabilities the americans with disabilities act isn a suggestion it a mandate it time our society faces the fact that when it comes to the cops it cannot be mandate that is unfunded and unsupported we need more police video but it must be used correctly video was available only in 26 percent of the cases in which an unarmed person died after an encounter with police in two 2015 cases eyewitness shot video was crucial in showing that officers had lied to investigators in two other cases video exonerated officers but in all four of these cases the video was taken by bystanders or surveillance cameras not by police operated video here another metric first observed by san jose independent police auditor walter katz last year there were zero indictments of police officers in cases that did not involve video in every case in which an officer was indicted video was available and became an important part of the evidence supporting indictment that an important metric we need more officer video in more places right now believe proliferation of body and dash cam cameras will mostly demonstrate that police usually get it right and perform their jobs with professionalism but it will also show when we are at our worst that too is important am strong proponent of body worn video but it not as easy as merely handing out the cameras as we ve already seen there are significant challenges to developing practical policies and procedures that bring transparency while still protecting citizen privacy and police officers due process rank and file officers union representatives where appropriate and community leaders and activists should be consulted during the policy building process so that there are no surprises sometimes policy can be counterintuitive for truly surprising read have look at the how the los angeles sheriff department handled the thorny issue of whether officers should be permitted to view video before writing their reports there are also logistical technological and financial barriers that need hashing out deaths in police custody aren always from shootings police shootings get most of the media coverage but in nearly half of the 153 cases in which cops killed an unarmed citizen in 2015 no shots were fired at all the decedent was killed in another manner in most of these cases autopsy reports found that the deceased had an abnormal reaction or complication after officers deployed tools or techniques with the intent of using of non deadly force such as stun guns or chemical spray many of these cases include the drug related mental health related deaths described previously as well as other incidents in which decedents with chronic health conditions or physical disability attacked or resisted officers or others in 23 of the 83 cases 27 percent in which there were shootings officers deployed taser prior to shooting to my colleagues and me this is good indication that officers were attempting to subdue suspects who ultimately died by first using non deadly force that would be consistent with current best practices that conclusion has frustrated some observers because activists and reformers have pointed to tasers as weapons that cause too many deaths part of the problem is that there a lot of confusion in the general public about weapon potential to cause death and whether it should be considered deadly force by law practice and training without devolving into festival of scholarly citations the law is quite clear about this deadly force is force that poses significant risk of death or serious bodily injury legal experts have tended to agree that significant risk means more likely than not some people have indeed died proximate to taser exposure but the numbers are very small independent non taser funded research has repeatedly shown that the percentage of people exposed to taser who die soon after that exposure is minuscule and even among those cases it difficult to establish causal link see for example this arizona state university study or this nij study there have been millions of taser exposures and very few deaths in definition and in practice taser is non deadly force our data show that in nearly third of the cases in which officers used deadly force they first attempted non deadly force yes there have been awful examples of taser proximate injuries suffered when an officer used the weapon not because suspect was fighting but to gain control or out of anger that is generally fireable offense and sometimes criminal act but that a separate issue from the cases my team studied in which police officers faced real threat and deployed taser to stop potentially deadly incident by using non deadly force consider if you will the death of omar lopez last year lopez had been fighting passenger on the septa train in philadelphia when police officer intervened lopez bit and violently fought with the officer the officer armed with 40 sig sauer pistol and baton continued to struggle and ultimately used his taser alone lopez died but the autopsy showed his cause of death to be an overdose of pcp that officer like officers in many of the incidents we studied showed tremendous restraint when we credit officers who first opt for non deadly force others are less likely to reach first for their guns think reasonable people would agree each of these reforms is individually actionable none is dependent on the others and few seem all that divisive or controversial with couple of exceptions the solution for each is relatively inexpensive relatively uncomplicated and relatively understandable once we can see beyond the how many of police involved killings and look instead to the why we can start to have meaningful conversations about how to reduce them https www washingtonpost com news the watch wp 2016 06 20 guest post the low hanging fruit

73,hi guys so basically about year ago was in the hospital for week for an endoscopic surgery and when got back from the hospital had no responsibilities for about 5 months and just stayed in my room on my computer for mostly all day and stayed up late doing this had little human interaction during that time because wanted to be alone and also for the past few 2 years leading up to the surgery my interaction with people was reduced significantly due to my eating disorder which made me isolate myself from people now when am around people and even when am alone in my room feel like am not real and that nothing around me is real and am always afraid that am dying or going to die soon from heart failure or forgetting how to breathe also cant focus in on anything and feel like life is just passing me by so fast and am not actually in my body because have derealization symptoms was wondering is this because have been separated from people for so long also can this feeling go away ,yes

76,march 21 2016 2 08am edt current clinical trials are evaluating stem cell therapies for conditions ranging from eye disease to aids discoveries in stem cell science over the past decade are finally starting to reach the clinic current clinical trials are evaluating stem cell therapies for conditions ranging from eye disease to aids these trials are going on in the united states europe canada japan and elsewhere but australia is lagging behind while we remain fairly competitive in fundamental research we are slow to translate our discoveries into new therapies this concern was expressed in the australian academy of science report released today called the stem cell revolution lessons and imperatives for australia it contains series of recommendations from young research leaders in the field on how australian science policy can help fast track stem cell research here researchers are often asked by patients or their relatives when stem cell treatments will be available for certain medical conditions ten years ago the answer would have been that there are no new treatments yet but we are working to develop them today we are forced to answer that clinical trials of cell therapies for particular conditions are going on but not in australia we have an obligation to ensure that australian patients their families carers and physicians are not left behind in the stem cell revolution stem cell therapy human embryonic stem cells which can become cells in any tissue of the body were first discovered in 1998 today embryonic stem cell treatment trials are underway for macular degeneration common form of blindness spinal cord injury juvenile diabetes and heart failure embryonic stem cell therapies are being trialled for macular degeneration common form of blindness embryonic stem cell therapies are being trialled for macular degeneration common form of blindness then there are the induced pluripotent stem ips cells that japanese scientist shinya yamanaka discovered which won him the nobel prize in 2012 ips cells are made from adult tissues and have many of the defining properties of embryonic stem cells they can be made from skin or blood cells of any person after yamanaka discovery japan cell therapy regulatory framework was modified to fast track products from these new stem cells into the clinic as consequence therapies using induced ips cells which enable close tissue matching of stem cell transplants to patients to prevent graft rejection are now in clinical trials there only ten years after their discovery more trials will begin very soon for instance years of research on midbrain dopaminergic neurons the cells lost in parkinson disease has paved the way for upcoming trials of stem cells replacing these lost neurons there are also large number of human trials in progress using mesenchymal stem cells which are extracted from bone marrow fat or other tissues capable of modulating the immune system and inflammatory response these stem cells have the potential ability to treat arthritis autoimmune disorders graft versus host disease in bone marrow transplant patients and number of other conditions neural stem cells derived from either foetal or adult brain tissue are also undergoing testing in humans for rare inherited disorders of the brain or more common conditions including spinal cord injury it unlikely these early stage trials will produce cures for any of these conditions indeed they might pose as many questions as they answer but it is essential and significant that these trials are moving forward because the lessons we learn from them will guide us towards the design of the next generation of cellular therapeutics gene therapy and drug discovery today genetic modification of stem cells with precision can provide cell therapies that can permanently correct serious genetic disorders human embryonic stem cells can become cells in tissue in any part of the body for years progress in gene therapy was almost totally blocked by safety concerns around the relatively crude technologies for introducing genetic alterations into patient cells but technological advances have enabled precise correction of genetic defects within cell this avoids off target modifications that can cause cancers and other serious toxicities new treatments using combined gene and cell therapy are undergoing trials now the california institute of regenerative medicinelists about ten new human studies including in aids blood diseases and cancer then there is third stream of stem cell research that although perhaps less visible to the general public has implications well beyond cell therapy this is the ability to derive pluripotent stem cells from patients with genetic predisposition to disease or to introduce disease mutations into stem cells via gene editing we can then use these disease specific stem cell lines to generate the cell types affected in particular disorder to study what goes wrong with them in the lab for instance we can study how gene that causes epilepsy affects the electrical properties of human nerve cells once we develop these cell culture models we can use them to screen candidate drugs to correct the deficits in the affected cells this technology will enable us to reduce dependence on animal models which don always replicate human diseases and will reduce the risk of testing drugs on living human subjects these advances have the potential to speed the discovery of new medicines to rapidly eliminate candidate drugs that might cause toxicity in the clinic and to save millions from the costs of drug development to ensure australian patients have timely access to new stem cell therapies for intractable diseases we must maintain our excellence in fundamental stem cell research but we also need to develop new and better mechanisms to support collaboration between academia the private sector and philanthropists with the aim of translating discoveries into cures

hypertension 5 congestive heart failure 6 seizure disorder procedures performed 1 colonoscopy 2 right hemicolectomy hospital course the patient is 59 year old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years previous mi and coronary artery disease history of seizure disorder gerd bipolar disorder and anemia she was admitted due to seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia regarding the seizure disorder neurology was consulted noncontrast ct of the head was negative neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg i regarding the hypoglycemia the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour her insulin pump had basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings while in the hospital the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1 5 and then subsequently decreased few other times she seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course there were few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia but the episode seem to be related to the patient n o status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course at discharge her endocrinologist was contacted it was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 m from 0 8 units per hour from 6 m until 8 m and then at 0 2 units per hour from 8 m until 6 m the insulin was to be novolog regarding the anemia the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive hemoccult stools colonoscopy was performed which found mass at the right hepatic flexure general surgery was then consulted and right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient the patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour regarding the cancer itself it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer ct of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis ct of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis later in hospital course the patient developed septic like picture likely secondary to hospital acquired pneumonia she was treated with zosyn levaquin and vancomycin and tolerated the medications well her symptoms decreased and serial chest rays were followed which showed some resolution of the illness the patient was seen by the infectious disease specialist the infectious disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover mrsa bacteria which was found at the tube site at discharge the patient was given three additional days of o levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of bactrim ds every 12 hours the bactrim was used to cover the mrsa at the tube site it was found that mrsa was sensitive to bactrim throughout her hospital course the patient continued to receive coreg 12 5 mg daily and lasix 40 mg twice day for her congestive heart failure which remains stable she also received lipitor for her high cholesterol her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night the dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis discharge instructions medications the patient was discharged to home she was told to shy away from strenuous activity her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the tube at rate of 120 per hour throughout the night the discharge medications were as follows 1 coreg 12 5 mg o i 2 lipitor 10 mg o at bedtime 3 nitro dur patch 0 3 mg per hour one

89,history of present illness was kindly asked to see ms abc who is 74 year old woman for cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after fall the patient is somnolent at this time but does arouse but is unable to provide much history by review of the chart it appears that she fell which is what she states when she got up out of rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor she states that 1 1 2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor the patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath past medical history includes end stage renal disease from hypertension she follows up with dr in her office and has been known to have small to moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11 07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done she had an echocardiogram today please see also that report which shows stable and small to moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55 with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy mildly dilated right ventricular size normal right ventricular ejection fraction moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension estimated pa systolic pressure of 71 mmhg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08 29 07 previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the pa systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmhg other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description she has history of longstanding hypertension she has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure history of mini strokes documented several years ago history of seizure disorder she has history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion she has history of hypertension depression hyperlipidemia on sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism past surgical history includes cholecystectomy post fistula in the left arm which has failed and right arm which is being used including number of operative procedures to the fistula she follows up with dr regarding neurovascular surgery medications on admission 1 norvasc 10 mg once day 2 aspirin 81 mg once day 3 colace 200 mg two at bedtime 4 labetalol 100 mg o i 5 nephro vite one tablet o a 6 dilantin 100 mg o i 7 renagel 1600 mg o i 8 sensipar 120 mg o every day 9 sertraline 100 mg o nightly 10 zocor 20 mg o nightly allergies to medications per chart are none family history unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when am talking social history unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when am talking review of systems unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when am talking physical exam temperature 99 2 blood pressure ranges from 88 41 to 108 60 pulse 70 respiratory rate 20 o2 saturation 98 height is 5 feet 1 inch weight 147 pounds on general exam she is pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted heent shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic she has moist mucosal membranes neck veins are difficult to assess but do not appear clinically distended no carotid bruits lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly no wheezes cardiac exam s1 s2 regular rate 3 6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla no rub no gallop pmi is nondisplaced abdomen soft nondistended cva is benign extremities with no significant edema pulses appear grossly intact she has evidence of right upper extremity edema which is apparently chronic diagnostic data lab data ekgs are reviewed including from 07 07 09 at 08 31 m which shows atrial fibrillation with left anterior fascicular block poor wave progression when compared to one done on 07 06 09 at 18 25 there is really no significant change the atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on ekg done on 11 02 07 and this ekg is not significantly changed from the most recent one echocardiogram results as above chest ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion bnp shows 3788 sodium 136 potassium 4 5 chloride 94 bicarbonate 23 bun 49 creatinine 5 90 troponin was 0 40 followed by 0 34 inr 1 03 on 05 18 07 white blood cell count 9 4 hematocrit 42 platelet count 139 impression ms abc is 74 year old woman admitted to the hospital with fall and she has history of vascular dementia so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time she does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and found an ekg report by dr which shows atrial fibrillation on 08 29 07 per her report one of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be candidate for coumadin clearly given her history of small mini strokes think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk if not felt to be significant fall risk then would strongly recommend coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year would defer that decision to dr and dr xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate recommendations 1 fall assessment as per dr and dr xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on coumadin given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol 2 the patient has elevated bnp and suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis 3 regarding this minimal troponin elevation do not feel this is diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small to moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade would defer to her usual cardiologist dr whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification did find that the patient had prior cardiac stress test in 08 07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study as well 4 continue norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol 5 the patient is felt to be significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once day for secondary cva thromboprophylaxis albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin 6 continue dilantin for history of seizures ,yes

99,history the patient is an 86 year old woman with history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in setting of hypokalemia incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with cpap chocolate caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with diltiazem iv she has maintained atrial fibrillation have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks benefits and alternatives of the procedure after an in depth discussion of the procedure please see my initial consultation for further details asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday the patient declined invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate procedure note the appropriate time out procedure was performed as per medical center protocol including proper identification of the patient physician procedure documentation and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff the patient participated actively in this she received total of 4 mg of versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect she was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the ap position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm this was confirmed on 12 lead ekg impression plan successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation the patient electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with cpap and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress she will be discharged on her usual robust av nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg o i metoprolol 50 mg o i diltiazem cd 240 mg o daily and digoxin 0 125 mg o daily and to be clear she does have permanent pacemaker implanted she will follow up with her regular cardiologist dr for whom am covering this weekend this was all discussed in detail with the patient as well as her granddaughter with the patient verbal consent at the bedside ,yes

101,history of present illness the patient is an 84 year old woman with history of hypertension severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension mild aortic stenosis and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after fall basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances on her driveway and on her left side hit rock when she came to the emergency room she was found to have rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia and was put on cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s so that was stopped review of ekgs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup ekg showing wandering atrial pacemaker an ecg this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs her potassium at that time was 3 1 she does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior she denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall she states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems past cardiac history she is followed by dr in our office and has history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and pa pressure on 05 12 08 preserved left and right ventricular systolic function aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis and bi atrial enlargement she has previously had persantine myoview nuclear rest stress test scan completed at abcd medical center in 07 06 that was negative she has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05 12 08 that was not felt to be significant she has history of hypertension and ekgs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs versus wandering atrial pacemaker she does have history of significant hypertension in the past she has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope she has had bradycardia in the past from beta blocker therapy medications on admission 1 multivitamin o daily 2 aspirin 325 mg once day 3 lisinopril 40 mg once day 4 felodipine 10 mg once day 5 klor con 20 meq o i 6 omeprazole 20 mg o daily presumably for gerd 7 miralax 17 p daily 8 lasix 20 mg o daily allergies penicillin it is listed that toprol has caused shortness of breath in her office chart and believe she has had significant bradycardia with that in the past family history she states her brother died of an mi suddenly in his 50s social history she does not smoke cigarettes abuse alcohol nor use any illicit drugs she is retired from morse chain and delivering newspapers she is widowed she lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it review of systems she denies history of stroke cancer vomiting of blood coughing up blood bright red blood per rectum bleeding stomach ulcers she does not recall renal calculi nor cholelithiasis denies asthma emphysema pneumonia tuberculosis sleep apnea home oxygen use she does note occasional peripheral edema she is not aware of prior history of mi she denies diabetes she does have history of gerd she notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone she denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above physical exam height 5 feet 0 inches weight 123 pounds

general exam she is pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing but is alert and interactive heent shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic she has moist mucosal membranes neck veins were not distended there are no carotid bruits lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes she is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture cardiac exam s1 s2 regular rate frequent

minute no ischemic changes she had followup ekg done at 20 37 on 08 19 08 which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral wave changes not significantly changed from prior followup ekg done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs impression she is an 84 year old female with history of hypertension severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery telemetry now reviewed shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia which has been corrected there has been no atrial fibrillation documented do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath she actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil which has been started which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia which she had and would watch for heart rate with that continued optimization of electrolytes the patient cannot take beta blockers as previously toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath although there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil the patient is aware of the cardiac risks certainly it is moderate and wishes to proceed with needed surgery do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with dr after discharge regarding her mild thrombocytopenia would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist ,yes

120,a diagram showing how stem cell in bone marrow becomes different types of blood cells click for credit in 2003 speech john kerry complained about the bush administration saying nothing illustrates this administration anti science attitude better than george bush cynical decision to limit research on embryonic stem cells during the heat of the stem cell wars this was common refrain life saving treatments could be produced with embryonic stem cells and anyone who questioned whether or not it was morally acceptable to destroy one life in order to experiment with saving another was anti science never mind that there are stem cells in everyone body commonly called adult stem cells and those stem cells also have the potential to cure illnesses everyone knew that using embryonic stem cells would be better what the difference between embryonic stem cells and adult stems cells well most of the cells in your body have specific tasks your skin cells perform one set of tasks while your muscle cells perform another set of tasks your liver cells another set of tasks etc etc these cells have all specialized so they can perform their tasks efficiently stem cell by contrast is cell that hasn yet specialized it can develop into many different cells depending on your body needs embryonic stem cells end up developing into all the cells that make up the body so they are thought to be very very flexible when it comes to what they can develop into however to get those stem cells you have to kill the embryo adult stem cells on the other hand have already specialized to some degree for example the drawing at the top of this post shows how an adult stem cell found in bone marrow can develop into various different blood cells while that shows some serious flexibility bone marrow stem cells don normally develop into wildly different cells like skin cells as result it is thought that adult stem cells aren as flexible as embryonic stem cells on the positive side however you don have to kill anything to get adult stem cells the scientific question then boils down to this is it worth working with stem cells that might not be as flexible as embryonic stem cells in order to avoid killing human embryos those who answered that question with yes have been routinely labelled anti science however now that we are 13 years past mr kerry speech we can see that adult stem cells have in fact demonstrated success in treating wide variety of illnesses obviously lot more research has to be done and none of these treatments are standard or routine yet nevertheless it is now clear that if there is limit to the abilities of adult stem cells when it comes to treating illnesses we haven reached it yet that brings me to the reason am writing this article over the past few days have seen two more examples of adult stem cells successfully treating illnesses the first example appears in jama neurology specialized publication of the journal of the american medical association this study dealt with the treatment of myasthenia gravis degenerative neuromuscular disorder that can be life threatening the authors of the study followed 7 patients that were treated with stem cells from their own bone marrow and all of them achieved stable remission and were freed from ongoing myasthenia gravis therapy 1 now of course this is small study and while some patients were followed for 13 years others were followed for only 2 5 years in addition the authors note that specialized patient care is necessary for this treatment to be effective as result they only recommend it for institutions that have experience treating patients with myasthenia gravis nevertheless it at least shows the potential of using patient own adult stem cells to treat neuromuscular disorder the other study isn as groundbreaking but it does provide new insights into the use of adult stem cells to treat heart failure the authors reported on randomized double blind placebo controlled study of end stage patients with serious heart failure the only hope such patients have is for heart transplant since that wasn possible for these patients they agreed to be part of study that examined the efficacy of treating their heart failure with once again stem cells from their own bone marrow the procedure typically took only two hours and most patients were released from the hospital the day after the procedure was done after 12 months those who received the treatment were 37 less likely to have been taken to hospital and 50 less likely to die than those who received placebo 2 while those numbers aren as wonderful as the numbers in the myasthenia gravis study they are significant in addition the study was the largest ever done on this kind of treatment thus it clearly shows that patients who need heart transplant have at least one other option thanks to adult stem cells far from being anti science then caution about using embryonic stem cells is scientifically reasonable adult stem cells have shown quite lot of promise and they avoid the moral problems associated with killing embryos references 1 adam bryant et al myasthenia gravis treated with autologous

139,preoperative diagnosis and indications acute non st elevation mi postoperative diagnosis and summary the patient presented with an acute non st elevation mi despite medical therapy she continued to have intermittent angina angiography demonstrated the severe lad as the culprit lesion this was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced she has residual lesions of 75 in the proximal right coronary and 60 proximal circumflex and the other residual lad lesions as noted above she will be continued on her medical therapy at age 90 she is not good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting procedure performed selective coronary angiography coronary angioplasty procedure in detail after informed consent was obtained the patient was taken to the cath lab placed on the table in the supine position the area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in sterile fashion using the percutaneous technique 6 french sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance with the guidewire in place 5 french jl 4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system the catheter was removed the sheath flushed the 5 french 3drc catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery the cath removed the sheath flushed it was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the lad which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non st elevation mi the patient was given bolus of heparin and an act of approximately 50 seconds was obtained we rebolused and the act was slightly lower we repeated the level and it was slightly higher we administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an act of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin iv additionally the patient had been given 300 mg of plavix orally during the procedure and integrilin iv bolus and then maintenance drip was started 6 french cls 3 5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and hew guidewire was positioned in the distal lad and another hew guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal an apex 2 5 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid lad stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated angiography was then performed demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent the balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium the balloon was inflated and removed repeat angiography performed we attempted to advance driver 2 5 24 mm bare metal stent but could not advance it beyond the proximal lad where there was significant calcification the stent was removed attempts to advance the same 2 5 15 mm apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful it was removed new apex 2 5 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal lad and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection one more attempt was made to advance the driver 2 5 24 mm bare metal stent but again could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal lad and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in 90 year old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection so the stent was removed the guidewires and guide cath were removed the sheath flushed and sutured into position the patient moved to icu in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all contrast isovue 370 120 ml fluoro time 9 4 minutes estimated blood loss 30 ml hemodynamics aorta 185 54 left ventriculography was not performed did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve the left main is large vessel giving rise to lad and circumflex vessels the left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls the lad is moderate to large vessel giving rise to small diagonals and then moderate to large third diagonal and then small fourth diagonal the lad has significant calcification proximally there is 50 stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent this resulted in 30 residual mostly eccentric calcified plaque following this there was 50 stenosis in the lad just after the takeoff of the third diagonal this was not ballooned beyond this is an 80 stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then 99 stenosis after the fourth diagonal these 2 lesions were dilated with 10 residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25 residual distal to the fourth diagonal as noted above this area was not stented because could not safely advance the stent note there was also 50 stenosis at the origin of the moderate to large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty the circumflex is large nondominant vessel consisting of large obtuse marginal with multiple branches the proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60 stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal the remainder of the vessel was without significant disease the right coronary was large dominant vessel giving rise to large posterior descending artery and small to moderate first posterolateral small second posterolateral and small to moderate third posterolateral branch the right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75 stenosis beginning about centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch the remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease ,yes

142,by john young obstructive sleep apnea is sleep disorder characterized by intermittent interruptions in breathing the affected individual has to wake up every so often to breathe persons with this problem tend to snore and are excessively tired and drowsy during the day due to lack of good quality of sleep there are number of facts on obstructive sleep apnea richardson tx residents need to understand if they are struggling with this problem the underlying problem in this condition is excessive relaxation of throat muscles these muscles comprise those of the soft palate the tonsils and the uvula the relaxed muscles narrow the space that is used by inhaled air total obstruction occurs intermittently for period of ten to twenty seconds causing arousal from sleep snoring is the resulting of vibrating loose muscles as air is forced through number of factors have been shown to predispose to this condition excessive weight is one of them this risk factor is present in about 50 of those affected it is believed to contribute to the problem due to increased fat deposition around the upper airway that subsequently leads to obstruction related to the same is the possession of large neck defined as circumference of more than 16 inches in women and 17 inches in men others are chronic nasal congestion smoking hypertension and diabetes if not treated this condition may lead to number of complications cardiovascular problems result from reduced oxygenation of blood that in turn causes strain on the heart the risk of hypertension heart failure and abnormal heart rhythm arrhythmia are increased another major complication is reduced productivity due to daytime fatigue children with the condition may have poorer academic performance compared to their peers the first step in dealing with this problem is to institute lifestyle changes one of them is to lose excess weight if you have been classified as being overweight or obese other measures that can be undertaken easily include taking part in regular physical exercise reducing smoking and alcohol intake in case of nasal congestion steroid based nasal decongestants offer some benefits other treatment options are considered in case the lifestyle changes prove ineffective there are number of devices that can be used to open up blocked airways and reduce the severity of obstruction you will need to see dental specialist to get the device that is most appropriate in your case surgery may be used as last resort the type of operation that is performed is dependent on the cause one of the commonly performed procedures is removal of loose tissues around the upper airway procedure known as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty upp involves the removal of tonsils the uvula and part of the soft palate this is considered major operation that is done under general anesthesia jaw surgery is another alternative that helps increase the space behind the tongue the most important thing about sleep apnea is to seek treatment early while the rate of complications is fairly low there is profound effect on the quality of life of the affected persons and their loved ones fortunately lifestyle modifications are effective in many of the persons suffering from the condition about the author to seek treatment for obstructive sleep apnea richardson tx dental professionals urge you to refer to the recommended clinic make an appointment online using this website http dentalandbeyond com ,no

145, original post by democracy ve really enjoyed it as student it one of the few placements where ve felt ve been learning at every moment and sometimes helping to make difference too would hope to have similar experience during foundation years though like you ve been told it terrible as career and to steer well clear m not that interested in the long term management of chronic conditions g heart failure asthma etc but find learning about the acute exacerbations of the same conditions really interesting not big fan of clinics or ward rounds either but still really enjoy clerkings and presenting patients also really like learning practical procedures and the idea of being generalist is appealing all of the em physicians ve been attached to have been great teachers and think it a specialty which would lend itself well to clinical teaching not going to deny that it physically tiring and whilst don mind night shifts don like it when they yo yo and leave you feeling jet lagged new contract looks awful for this so ll be interested to see what ll make of it hopefully once ve qualified how about you really similar reasons actually don like the long ward rounds and constant irrelevant shuffling of treatment in medicine but m certainly no surgeon either love seeing patients acutely working out the problem doing wide range of practical procudures and then never having to see them again don get me wrong love people but don really like to get bogged down in complicated stuff like the fact that it intense tiring and when you re there you have to be very present and then when it done it done and you go home nothing better also don mind working unsociable hours in many ways prefer them m definite night owl and will happily take the extra money and be awake at time that suits me nicely the unavoidable shift work nature is something of concern but my ideal plan is to locum for half of the year and travel the rest not sure how viable that is and everything up in the air right now don know can actually see myself doing anything else except maybe gp and gp doesn exactly enthuse me ,no
146,another step towards finding best treatment combo for each individual patient eurekalert science newsa service of the american association for the advancement of science public release 29 feb 2016 single dose of trastuzumab kick starts immune response in certain breast cancers case western reserve university tumor immune response to single dose of the her2 inhibitor trastuzumab predicted which patients with her2 positive breast cancer would respond to the drug on more long term basis according to the results of study published recently in clinical cancer research in addition vinay varadan phd assistant professor at case western reserve university school of medicine and member of the case comprehensive cancer center and his colleagues found that women with the her2 enriched subtype of her2 positive breast cancer subtype that is estrogen and progesterone receptor negative had the highest rate of immune response to treatment with trastuzumab with significant increases in immune response after single dose of the drug our study showed for the first time that the immune cell activating properties of trastuzumab are likely related to the subtypes of breast cancer varadan said knowing this can inform future trials studying the usefulness of adding immunotherapy drugs to trastuzumab only one half of women with her2 positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab will have their tumor completely respond to therapy prior to undergoing surgery to remove the mass even when second her2 targeting drug such as pertuzumab is combined with trastuzumab only 60 of women have complete response therefore there is need to find ways to identify women who are the most likely to respond to this presurgical treatment prior research showed that patient own immune system can play role in determining whether the tumor will respond to therapy with trastuzumab to look into this association further varadan and his colleagues used data from two clinical trials to measure the molecular makeup of breast tumors after treatment with single dose of trastuzumab they examined how and if the immune system interacted with the drug and if the immune associated properties of trastuzumab were related to the subtype of her2 positive breast cancer women with the her2 enriched subtype of disease had the highest rate of tumor response compared with other disease subtypes in patients taken from both clinical trials based on these results varadan and colleagues used molecular signature immune index to measure the amount of immune activity occurring within the tumor tissue again the her2 enriched subtype tumors had significant increases in immune activity after only one dose of trastuzumab compared with the other subtypes we found that higher immune index evaluated after just one dose of trastuzumab predicted the tumor response varadan said this response seems to be specific to trastuzumab there was no association between immune activity and the subtype of breast cancer in patients who were given single dose of another chemotherapy also the predictive ability of the immune index test was not observed in patient tumors before any therapy was given suggesting that just single dose exposure may be beneficial way to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from trastuzumab based chemotherapy and thus do not need additional anti her2 treatment varadan said finally the researchers wanted to identify which types of immune cells were associated with this brief exposure to trastuzumab they found that signatures of cell activity key immune response were consistently predictive of response after one dose of trastuzumab suggesting that the immune system is likely playing key role in enabling the therapeutic benefits of trastuzumab specifically pd 1 expression marker of cells was significantly increased in women with the her2 enriched subtype of disease this suggests that this subtype of breast cancer may benefit most from the addition of drugs that target pd 1 given that the subtypes of her2 positive disease and the immune signatures predict response to trastuzumab based therapy the next question is whether these signatures can also predict response to dual her2 targeted therapyvaradan said additionally we would like to understand why certain breast cancers have strong immune response when treated with anti her2 therapy while others escape immune surveillance we are poised to answer these questions using both lab based research as well as an ongoing preoperative clinical trial case14112 being conducted

147,the best food sources of potassium the recommended daily value of 4 700 milligrams for adult men and women how to solve an electrolyte imbalance1 adjust your diet the first step to correcting an electrolyte imbalance is to identify how it developed in the first place for many people poor diet that high in processed foods containing lots of sodium but low in other electrolytes like magnesium or potassium paves the way for dangerous imbalance in many cases minor electrolyte imbalance can be corrected by simply making dietary changes and cutting way back on junk foods takeout and restaurant foods while instead cooking more fresh foods at home focus your diet around whole unpackaged foods especially plenty of vegetables and fruits that provide potassium and magnesium some of the best include leafy greens cruciferous veggies like broccoli or cabbage starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes or squash bananas and avocados diet that rich in magnesium or potassium likely can be enough to solve problems like low potassium levels that can lead to blood pressure problems or magnesium deficiency that can contribute to anxiety restlessness and muscle cramps to prevent dehydration and restore electrolytes focus on these foods which are some of the most hydrating due to being very water dense coconut water celery watermelon cucumber kiwi bell peppers citrus fruit carrots cultured dairy amasai kefir yogurt pineappleanother thing to consider is whether you re consuming enough calcium with or without eating dairy products it possible to get calcium from leafy greens other veggies beans and legumes to obtain enough calcium naturally without needing supplements consider adding high quality and ideally raw dairy products to your diet if you can tolerate them foods like organic probiotic yogurt cultured raw cheeses and raw milk provide high levels of electrolytes in addition to other important nutrients 2 monitor your sodium intake when you do consume packaged or processed foods check the sodium levels sodium is an electrolyte that plays significant part in the body ability to retain or release water so if your diet is very high in sodium more water is excreted by the kidneys and this can cause complications with balancing other electrolytes here how sodium works within the body essentially water follows salt which means if you increase sodium too much water retention also occurs at the same time the opposite is also true loss in sodium results in loss in water potentially causing dehydration and extreme thirst hypernatremia the name of the condition that develops when either too much water is lost or too much sodium is obtained is more common among older adults people with diabetes and those who eat heavily processed diets people can also lose high level of sodium through diarrhea taking certain diuretics or laxatives and exercising to extreme levels and overtraining without staying hydrated all of which cause problems of their own monitoring how much sodium you consume helps keep symptoms at bay including bloating lethargy dehydration weakness irritability and muscle twitching drinking water and eating mostly whole foods not the kinds that come in packages also ensures you obtain enough other important electrolytes 3 drink enough water but not too much electrolyte imbalances can develop when the amount of water in your body changes either causing dehydration not enough water compared to certain elevated electrolytes or overhydration too much water drinking enough water without over diluting your cells helps stop levels of sodium and potassium from rising too high or too low how much water is the right amount for you it all depends on your specific needs do you exercise often do you live in warm climate that results in you sweating do you eat lot of water rich fruits or vegetables or more processed foods while eight glasses day has always been the standard recommendation this isn necessarily the best amount for every person since factors like your diet age physical activity level and body size all determine how much water you need good rule of thumb is to drink enough so you urinate at least every three to four hours which for most people is around eight to 10 eight ounce glasses daily if you practice vigorous exercise especially in warm hot weather that increases sweat production make sure to replenish with plenty of water and electrolytes like premade formulas that include sodium if you ve been sick including with fever that causes vomiting or diarrhea keep in mind that you lose fluids and should increase your intake if not you risk developing dehydration symptoms kidney stones bladder infections urinary tract stones and potentially even heart failure that why it so important to protect yourself from dehydration women who are pregnant or breast feeding also need additional fluids about 10 13 cups every day to stay hydrated and prevented deficiencies as do teenagers who are growing and developing faster than people of other ages is it possible to drink too much water over hydration is rare but yes it possible your kidneys are unable to excrete very high levels of excess water so this can mean electrolytes within the blood can become diluted the result might be low sodium levels which is more common among endurance athletes who often try to compensate for sweating by drinking lots of water but not very likely to develop in someone eating the standard american diet that high in salt white beans 4 1 cup cooked 1 004 milligrams lima beans 5 1 cup cooked 955 milligrams avocado

failure adhf the 12 lead ecg reveals only sinus tachycardia and your nurse asks you how much furosemide you want to give congestive heart failure is common problem in the united states with more than five million patients carrying the diagnosis and 500 000 new diagnoses each year mt sinai med2006 73 2 506 ape occurs when blood backs up into the pulmonary vasculature leading to increased oncotic pressure and leakage of fluid into the alveolar spaces put more simply these patients are drowning ape patients suffer from increased afterload making it more difficult for the left ventricle to function and increased preload as such the goals of treatment must be directed at decreasing cardiac filling pressures preload and decreasing afterload neurohormonal activation also worsens cardiac performance and increases intravascular volume and vascular tone the mainstay of ape treatment for decades has been loop diuretics mainly furosemide the central role these drugs continue to play highlights lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the disease pathophysiology of ape the cardiorenal model was first put forward in the 1940s as the predominant explanation for ape it was believed that decreased blood flow to the kidneys led to decreased renal function and fluid retention leading to volume overload this was the basis for loop diuretics being recommended it was clear however that this model was insufficient because it did not explain why the disease progressed or the finding of increased peripheral vasoconstriction from invasive monitoring studies the cardiocirculatory model was first put forth in the 1970s this model argued that peripheral vasoconstriction led to decreased cardiac function and that increased preload and afterload were at the center of the problem this model explained much of what we see occurring in ape finally researchers in the 1990s established the neurohormonal model in which neurohormones norepinephrine renin angiotensin aldosterone are upregulated in ape these compounds have vasoactive properties leading to vasoconstriction and increase intravascular volume current recommendations for ape treatment are based on the integration of the cardiovascular and the neurohormonal models the myth of volume overload regardless of the pathophysiology patients are still volume overloaded right the best evidence suggests it is not that simple zile et al demonstrated that most patients with ape have increased cardiac filling pressures but most did not have significant increase from their dry weight on presentation circulation 2008 118 14 1433 more than 50 percent of patients in fact gain less than two pounds circulation2007 116 14 1549 if this is not fluid gain where did the increased filling pressure originate it turns out it is largely result of changes in compliance in the splanchnic system that leads to fluid shifting from here to the cardiopulmonary circulation circ heart fail2011 4 5 669 even in the face of this evidence the loop diuretic supporters argue that some patients are overloaded so why not give all of these patients the drug this approach does not account for the potential downsides administration of furosemide activates the neurohormonal system which leads to increased plasma renin and norepinephrine levels this results in decreased lv function increased lv

170,oh quick addition too so mentioned how the edv stays the same to maintain co but didn really mention why ventricular edv approximates preload which is dependent on venous tone and circulating blood volume venous return curves these are not effected in this situation and since co is not decreased that side of things doesn affect the venous return either so it stays the same the heart pumps what comes into it anything less and it is in systolic heart failure again see cardiac function curves just thought d throw that integration in there quick hope it helpful sent from my iphone using sdn mobile app,no

183, naturalhealth365 recent study is now showing strong evidence of link between lack of vitamin and poor cardiovascular health the study results show that low vitamin levels have been linked with higher risk of having heart attack stroke or heart failure among other health issues the results come from an innovative study conducted by the intermountain medical center heart institute of salt lake city the study findings were presented at the american college of cardiology scientific sessions in chicago avoid low vitamin levels this is powerful way to protect your heart higher risk of stroke heart issues and cardiac events seem to correlate with low levels of specific vitamin component as well as deficient overall levels the researchers found that those with low vitamin levels in both bioavailable and total amounts had more cardiovascular health challenges bioavailable vitamin refers to vitamin in the bloodstream but not attached to proteins for the study lead researcher cardiovascular epidemiologist dr heidi may and her colleagues studied vitamin levels in 4 200 older adults around 70 percent of the participants showed coronary artery disease and quarter had diabetes the research team looked at levels of vitamin elements produced during metabolism to find connections to future cardiac issues studying the unbound bioavailable vitamin was key as only 10 to 15 percent of vitamin can act during metabolism however both total vitamin levels and bioavailable amounts were accurate in predicting the risk of heart issues down the road vitamin is crucial to many areas of your health profile the study ultimately concluded that people with higher vitamin levels had the lowest risk of heart attack heart failure stroke and death the study underscores the importance of vitamin to overall health throughout our lifetime other research has shown how important vitamin is to memory cognitive health and avoiding alzheimer in older age as well persons already experiencing coronary health issues should consider having their vitamin levels checked and take action if lack of vitamin is detected doing so could be crucial to cardiovascular and overall health sunshine diet and supplements can all provide vitamin while vitamin can be prescribed or taken in supplement form one of the best ways to receive it is from the sun it should be noted that people of different races tend to process vitamin at different levels those with darker skin may require more supplementation regardless of sun exposure foods that are rich in vitamin include fatty fish like salmon sardines and herring raw milk and some breakfast cereals contain vitamin but one must be careful about food allergies if they exist in addition whole eggs mushrooms and ricotta cheese offer vitamin but again how the food was produced plus dietary sensitivities must be considered before choosing way of eating bottom line get your vitamin level tested don guess and make the necessary

and muscle tissue one of the key amino acids used to form collagen and gelatin glycine can be found in bone broth and other protein sources in fact glycine along with many other nutrients like proline and arginine is part of what gives superfood bone broth its amazing healing abilities glycine benefits uses according to research done by the departments of cell and developmental biology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill glycine can be used to help lower symptoms in people suffering from conditions like ulcers arthritis leaky gut syndrome diabetes kidney and heart failure neurobehavioral disorders chronic fatigue sleep disorders and even certain cancers 1 amino acids such as glycine can be found in supplement form but it easy and probably even more beneficial to acquire them from natural food sources some of the many health benefits of glycine include helping build lean muscle mass preventing scaropenia muscle loss muscle wasting or deterioration playing role in the production of human growth hormone boosting mental performance and memory helping prevent strokes and seizures protecting skin from signs of aging or cellular mutations protecting collagen in joints and reducing joint pain improving flexibility and range of motion stabilizing blood sugar and lowering risk for type 2 diabetes improving sleep quality lowering inflammation and free radical damage by increasing glutathione production reducing risk for certain types of cancer building the lining of the gastrointestinal tract producing bile salts and digestive enzymes helping reduce allergic and autoimmune reactions boosting energy levels and fighting fatigue helping produce red blood cells fighting the effects of stress and anxiety helping control symptoms of seizures schizophrenia and mental disorders among all of these benefits here are several key ways glycine is used in the body 1 promotes muscle growth glycine has been found to help inhibit the deterioration of valuable protein tissue that forms muscle and boosts muscle recovery in fact it known as an anti aging amino acid because of how it helps maintain lean muscle mass into old age stimulates the secretion of human growth hormone prevents loss of cartilage in joints and even improves daytime energy physical performance and mental capabilities all important for athletes 2 3 glycine is used during the biosynthesis of creatine which provides muscles with direct source of fuel to repair damage and grow back stronger it also helps provide cells with energy thanks to its role in the conversion of nutrients from your diet helping feed hungry muscle tissues and boosting endurance strength and performance it also has benefits when it comes to hormone production and regulation helping the body naturally synthesize steroid hormones that regulate the ratio of fat to muscle mass and control energy expenditure 4 2 repairs and protects joints and cartilage together with other amino acids found in bone broth especially proline glycine plays part in the formation of collagen promoting the growth and function of joints tendons and ligaments approximately one third of collagen is composed of glycine and collagen is crucial for forming connective tissue that keeps joints flexible and able to withstand shock this is why collagen hydrolysate is often used for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases like osteoarthritis 5 as people get older it especially important to consume enough proteins amino acids in order to repair damaged tissues within joints that suffer due to ongoing free radical damage glycine is essential for the formation of stretchy flexible cartilage helps heal damaged joints and can prevent loss of mobility and functionality in older adults 6 3 improves digestion amino acids including glycine and proline help rebuild tissue that lines the digestive tract keeping food particles and bacteria inside the gut where they belong rather than allowing tiny openings to form that pass particles to the bloodstream where they trigger inflammation glycine helps form two of the most important substances that make up the gut lining collagen and gelatin collagen and gelatine help people with food allergies and sensitivities tolerate foods more easily can soothe the lining of the gi tract in people with inflammatory bowel diseases or indigestion including leaky gut syndrome ibs crohn ulcerative colitis and acid reflux and even promote probiotic balance and growth within the gi tract glycine also acts like metabolic fuel it needed to manufacture bile nucleic acids creatine phosphate and porphyrins to be used to break down nutrients from your diet for example it helps break down fats by aiding with the production of bile acids and helps transport glycogen to cells to be used for energy in the form of atp evidence also shows that glycine can help stabilize blood sugar levels leading to more lasting energy and preventing sugar cravings and fatigue 4 slows the effects of aging and builds the immune system glycine helps form glutathione valuable antioxidant that used to prevent cellular damage and various signs of aging 2011 study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition found that although glutathione deficiency in elderly people occurs because of marked reduction in synthesis supplementation with the glutathione precursors cysteine and glycine fully restores glutathione synthesis this helps increase concentrations and lowers levels of oxidative stress and oxidant damages that lead to aging 7 in certain studies glycine has even been found to help prevent cellular mutations that lead to cancer there some evidence that using targeted amino acid therapy can prevent the growth of cancerous cells by cutting off their energy supply and help turn down inflammation which is linked to numerous other chronic conditions besides cancer 5 calms the nerves and feeds the brain glycine is beneficial for supporting cognitive performance and the central nervous system because of how it helps regulate the metabolic synthesis of certain nutrients that the brain and nerves use for energy it helps regulate nerve impulses throughout the body by balancing electrolyte levels such as calcium chloride and potassium due to its role in both nerve and neurotransmitter functions glycine also has implications for helping improve sleep mental performance bodily sensations moods memory and behaviors for example glycine works with other amino acids including taurine and gamma amino butyric acid gaba as an inhibitory neurotransmitter some evidence shows that glycine can help reduce hyperactivity in the brain and even play role in the treatment or prevention of mental disorders including learning disabilities schizophrenia bipolar disorder manic depression and epilepsy certain studies have shown that glycine helps reduce psychotic symptoms strokes and seizures when used with other supplements as part of holistic treatment plan for mental cognitive illness 8 6 fights fatigue and promotes restful sleep due to its roles in the central nervous system and the digestive system glycine can help boost energy levels balance blood sugar and prevent fatigue it can even be used to calm anxiety or nervousness that keeps you up at night and gets in the way of getting good sleep plus it helps directly bring nutrients to cells and tissue for energy at all times of the day according to research done by the japanese society of sleep research glycine supplements improve sleep quality lessen daytime sleepiness and improve performance of memory recognition tasks 9 one of its most important functions is helping carry out the biosynthesis of heme component of haemoglobin that helps produce and maintain red blood cells 10 red blood cells help carry oxygen around the body support cellular functions and provide the tissue heart and brain with energy in fact glycine is often used in supplements meant to improve energy in athletes fight fatigue caused by anemia and help regulate blood sugar levels what is glycine classified as non essential also called conditional amino acid glycine can be made in small amounts by the human body itself but many people can benefit from consuming lot more from their diets thanks to its numerous beneficial roles nutritional information and facts about glycine glycine is the second most widespread amino acid found in human enzymes and proteins which is why it has roles in nearly every part of the body 11 it one of 20 amino acids used to make protein in the body which builds the tissue that forms organs joints and muscles of the proteins in the body it concentrated in collagen the most abundant protein in humans and many mammals and also gelatin substance made from collagen some of the most attractive attributes include promoting better muscle growth healing the lining of the gi tract and slowing down the loss of cartilage in joints and skin while high protein foods like meat and dairy products do contain some glycine the best sources collagen and gelatin can be hard to get these proteins are not found in most cuts of meat and instead are obtained from consuming parts of animals that today most people throw away skin bones connective tissue tendons and ligaments people who are ill recovering from surgery taking medications that hinder certain metabolic processes or who are under lot of stress can all use extra glycine for recovery glycine recipes supplements getting more glycine into your diet is probably even easier than you think bone broth is great source of naturally occurring glycine and other amino acids is inexpensive simple to make at home and has far reaching health benefits bone broth which is made from slowly simmering animal parts including bones skin and tendons in stock contains natural collagen which releases important amino acids and other substances that are often missing from the typical western diet however if you re not willing to consume bone broth for example you re vegetarian or vegan glycine can be obtained from plant foods too plant based sources include beans vegetables like spinach kale cauliflower cabbage and pumpkin plus fruits like banana and kiwi other than bone broth glycine can also be found in complete sources of proteins animal proteins including meat dairy products poultry eggs and fish don forget that glycine is also found in high amounts in gelatin substance made from collagen that used in certain food products and sometimes for cooking or food prep gelatin isn commonly eaten in large amounts but can be added to recipes when making some gelatin desserts yogurts raw cheeses or even ice cream here are several simple recipes you can make at home to boost your glycine intake homemade chicken bone broth recipe homemade beef bone broth recipe kale chips recipe cauliflower pizza crust recipe turkey chili with adzuki beans recipe when it comes to glycine supplements and dosage recommendations here what you need to know while some foods especially animal proteins and bone broth do provide some glycine amounts tend to be small overall so you need to consume supplements if you want to obtain higher dose there is no established daily requirement or upper limit of glycine at this time it believed that most people already get around two grams of glycine daily from their diets but needs differ lot depending on someone level of activity and state of health 12 depending on the symptoms you re looking to resolve you might benefit from consuming 10 times the average amount or even more not all protein amino acid supplements are created equal always look for high quality brands sold from reputable companies and consume food based supplements whenever possible because glycine is natural amino acid there not much risk for consuming too much from your diet in supplement form higher doses of glycine between 15 60 grams have been used safely to help resolve chronic conditions like mental disorders but this amount should be taken with supervision from doctor it not known if giving glycine supplements to children pregnant or breast feeding women or people with kidney or liver disease is safe or good idea so avoid using glycine in these cases for now glycine supplements can also interact with certain medications when taken in high doses such as those used by people with mental disorders including clozapine although for most people glycine is very safe especially in food form if you take medications it always good idea to get your doctor opinion when you begin to use any supplements final thoughts on glycine glycine is conditional non essential amino acid found in bone broth meat poultry eggs dairy products and certain beans and veggies it helps form collagen and gelatin substances that are important for building connective tissue throughout the body glycine is beneficial in both food and supplement form for people with joint pain digestive disorders like ibs ibd or food sensitives fatigue trouble sleeping anxiety and low immunity there is no recommended daily amount of glycine or upper limit and studies have found that it can be used safely in high doses up to 15 60 grams daily when necessary however estimates show that most people eating standard western diet consume only about two grams of glycine from their diets daily most likely because concentrated sources like animal tendons skins and bones are often thrown out read next what is collagen 7 ways collagen can boost your health,no

202,history of present illness mr is 50 year old gentleman with history of atrial fibrillation in the past more recently who has had atrial flutter who estimates he has had six cardioversions since 10 09 and estimates that he has had 12 to 24 in his life beginning in 2006 when the atrial fibrillation first emerged he since 10 17 m on 01 17 10 noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation called our office this morning that is despite being on flecainide atenolol and he is maintained on coumadin the patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12 lead ekg here otherwise no chest pain past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006 but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide he completed stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia medications as outpatient 1 atenolol 25 mg once day 2 altace 2 5 mg once day 3 zocor 20 mg once day 4 flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening 5 coumadin as directed by our office allergies to medications are none he denies shrimp sea food or dye allergy family history he has nephew who was his sister son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an mi but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well the patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist dr at general hospital and it sounds like he had negative ep study social history the patient does not smoke cigarettes abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine no use of illicit drugs he has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today cardiology consultation by his wife he is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide he has gotten sluggish he is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college review of systems he denies any history of stroke cancer vomiting of blood coughing up blood bright red blood per rectum bleeding stomach ulcers renal calculi there are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had formal sleep study physical exam blood pressure 156 93 pulse is 100 respiratory rate 18 on general exam he is pleasant overweight gentleman in no acute distress heent shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic he has moist mucosal membranes neck veins are not distended there are no carotid bruits visible skin warm and perfused affect appropriate he is quite oriented and pleasant no significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly no wheezes no egophony cardiac exam s1 s2 regular rate controlled no significant murmurs rubs or gallops pmi is nondisplaced abdomen is soft nondistended appears benign extremities without significant edema pulses grossly intact diagnostic studies lab data initial ecg shows atrial flutter impression mr is 50 year old gentleman with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed transesophageal echocardiogram guided cardioversion for him in late 12 20 09 who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks benefits and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion which the patient is in favor of after in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long term side effects past the acute procedure alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and or heart rate control with anticoagulation which the patient was not interested nor was primarily recommending as the next step and risks including but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all inclusive list but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents which would be less likely as did confirm with the patient that he had been p for greater than 15 hours risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias in the past when we had cardioverter with 150 joules he did have 5 5 second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy statistically less significant risk of cva although we cannot really make that null the patient expressed understanding of this risk benefit and alternative analysis invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self stated satisfaction we planned to go forward with the procedure procedure note the patient received total of 7 mg of versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time out procedure had been done as per the medical center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient position procedure documentation procedure indication and there were no questions the patient did actively participate in this time out procedure after the universal protocol was done he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using lollipop posterior patch with hands driven paddle on the side which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy there was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm in fact this time there was not significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12 09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by 12 lead ekg impression cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on coumadin and his inr is 3 22 we are going to watch him and discharge him from the medical center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening atenolol 25 mg once day coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again dr at electrophysiology unit at general hospital and will be planning to place call for dr myself again he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms had previously discussed the case with dr who is the patient general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient bedside regarding our findings ,yes

224,by ashish jha md reducing hospital use because hospitals are expensive and often cause harm there has been big focus on reducing hospital use this focus has been the underpinning for numerous policy interventions most notable of which is the affordable care act hospital readmissions reduction program hrrp which penalizes hospitals for higher than expected readmission rates the motivation behind hrrp is simple the readmission rate the proportion of discharged patients who return to the hospital within 30 days had been more or less flat for years and reducing this rate would save money and potentially improve care so it was big news when as the hrrp penalties kicked in government officials started reporting that the national readmission rate for medicare patients was declining rising use of observation status but during this time another phenomenon was coming into focus increasing use of observation status when patient needs hospital services there are two options that patient can be admitted for inpatient care or can be admitted to observation when patients are admitted to observation they essentially still get inpatient care but technically they are outpatients for variety of reasons we ve seen decline in patients admitted to inpatient status and rise in those going to observation status these two phenomena drop in readmissions and an increase in observation seemed related and others spoke publicly about our concerns that the drop in readmissions was being driven by increasing observation admissions an analysis by david himmelstein and steffie woolhandler in the health affairs blog suggested that most of the drop in readmissions could be accounted for both by increases in observation status and by increases in returns to the emergency department that did not lead to readmission two months later piece by claire noel miller and keith lund also in the health affairs blog found that the hospitals with the biggest drop in readmissions appeared to have big increases in their use of observation status it seemed like much of the drop in readmissions was about reclassifying people as observation and administratively lowering readmissions without changing care new data now comes terrific high quality study in the new england journal of medicine that takes this topic head on the authors examine directly whether the hospitals that lowered their readmission rates were the same ones that increased their observation status and find no correlation none if you re ever looking for scatter plot of two variables that are completely uncorrelated look no further than figure 3 of the paper the best reading of the evidence prior to the study did not turn out to be the truth it reminds me of the period we were all convinced based on excellent observational data that hormone replacement therapy was lifesaving for women with cardiovascular disease and that became the standard of care until someoneconducted randomized trial and found that hrt provided little benefit to these patients that why we do research it moves our knowledge forward where are we now so where does this leave us is the aca readmissions policy home run here what we know the hrrp has most likely we have no controls led to fewer patients being readmitted to the hospital second the hrrp does not seem responsible for the increase in observation stays here what we don know is drop in readmissions good thing for patients it may seem obvious that it is but if you think about it you realize that readmission rate is utilization measure not patient outcome it a measure of how often patients use inpatient services within 30 days of discharge utilization measures unto themselves don tell you whether care is good or bad so the real question is has the hrrp improved the underlying quality of care it might be that we have improved on care coordination communications between hospitals and primary care providers and ensuring good follow up that likely happened in some places alternatively it might be that we have just made it much harder for that older frail woman with heart failure sitting in the emergency room to get admitted if she was discharged in the last 30 days that too has likely happened in some places but how much of it is the former versus the latter until we can answer that question we won know whether care is better or not beyond understanding why readmissions have fallen we also don know how hrrp has affected the other things that hospitals ought to focus on such as mortality and infection rates if your parent was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia what would be your top priority most people would say that they would like their parent not to die the second might be to avoid serious complications like healthcare associated infection or fall that leads to hip fracture another might be to be treated with dignity and respect yes avoiding being readmitted would be nice but for me at least it pales in comparison to avoiding death and disability we know little about the potential spillover effects of the readmission penalties on the things that matter the most so here we are good news study that says readmissions are down because fewer people are being readmitted to the hospital not because people are being admitted to observation status that important but the real challenge is in figuring out whether patients are better off are they more likely to be alive after hospitalization do they have fewer functional limitations less pain and suffering until we answer those questions it ll be hard to know whether this policy is making the kind of difference we want and that the point of science using data to answer those questions because we all can have our opinions but ultimately it the data that counts ashish jha md mph

228,if you ve ever tried to lose weight you ve probably heard lot about water and weight loss can drinking more water really help you lose weight the short answer is yes and no if you re already well hydrated and getting plenty of water getting more water into your diet probably won make lot of difference but if you re going through your days little or lot dehydrated as many people are getting enough water could help dr christopher calapai o is manhattan osteopathic physician board certified in family medicine and anti aging medicine he states that there is always the case of too much of good thing some people are such water drinking devotees that they are aquaholics resulting in overhydration as result experts now fear we ve become so focused on staying hydrated that we re guzzling water to life threatening extremes dr calapai points out that there are two types of overhydration increased water intake and retaining water increased water intake or drinking more water than the kidneys can get rid of in the urine can cause too much water to collect in the body when the body is unable to get rid of excess water it is said to be retaining water this happens with several medical conditions for instance it can be dangerous because it throws off the balance between water and sodium in the blood overhydration caused by drinking too much water can occur both consciously and unconsciously dr calapai says that person may drink too much water during exercise some medications can also cause dry mouth and cause an increase in thirst increased thirst can also be caused by uncontrolled diabetes psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia primary polydipsia or psychogenic polydipsia can also cause compulsive water drinking what are the symptoms of overhydration symptoms of overhydration may not be recognized in the early stages but can include nausea and vomiting headache changes in mental state confusion or disorientation if left untreated overhydration can lead to dangerously low levels of sodium in the blood hyponatremia this can cause more severe symptoms such as muscle weakness spasms or cramps seizures unconsciousness coma how can overhydration be prevented endurance athletes can reduce the risk of overhydration by weighing themselves before and after race to determine how much water they have lost and need to replenish dr calapai emphasizes that individuals should avoid drinking more than one liter per hour of fluid drinking more fluids before and during race or anintensive athletic exertion can also help you avoid the need to drink too much water afterwards sports beverages that contain the electrolytes sodium and potassium are also recommended as both are lost in sweat so how do you know how much water you need for starters don rely solely on thirst says calapai as soon as you put water on your tongue you kill your thirst mechanism instead he suggests the following weigh yourself daily for week to check hydration your body weight shouldn fluctuate too much calapai says notice how much you pee and its color in the morning it should be copious amount and pale or clear aim to wake feeling hydrated if you re thirsty when you get out of bed in the morning you may not be consuming enough fluids when choosing sports drinks search for labels with low sugar dr calapai recommends about 5 grams per 8 ounce serving even natural drinks like coconut water have too much sugar and potassium to hydrate coffee tea and watery fruits and vegetables count toward fluid intake also caffeine is not diuretic dr calapai says it about volume so if you drink five cups you ll pee more start slowly sleep is six to eight hour fast so if you drink three cups of juice or water right away you ll trigger the volume response sip instead if you have an underlying medical condition such as diabetes congestive heart failure or kidney problems talk to your doctor about the best treatments for those conditions if you experience excessive thirst or an overly strong urge to drink water contact your doctor before you develop symptoms it could indicate medical problem that requires treatment dr christopher calapai o anti aging physician

256,there currently no treatment for cardiac fibrosis leading cause of heart failure but new research suggests there may be way to prevent it the study found specific triggers that activate the development of fibrosis blocking the triggers through the use of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring according to results in pre clinical model the bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable this is something that nobody has ever seen before says marek michalak co principal investigator and professor in biochemistry at the university of alberta cardiac fibrosis is considered permanent remodeling of the heart inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death the bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable luis agellon co principal investigator and professor at mcgill university school of dietetics and human nutrition says the findings offer hope to those who are living with heart failure prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to continue to function even if at reduced capacity currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and dismal prognosis improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals says agellon fibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure once person is diagnosed with heart failure about 30 percent will die within the first year next step clinical trials cardiac fibrosis itself is caused by variety of factors including high blood pressure overwork of cardiac muscle and long term consumption of diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar all cause increased stress to heart cells individuals with diabetes cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk it almost like building scar says michalak it exactly the same type of biological activity but it happening in the tissue in the heart it destroys the ability of the heart to function normally heart risks spike after 2 weeks of sugary drinks the team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans they also aim to gain better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring we don yet have full understanding nobody does of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells explains michalak so another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level how can this bile acid affect the heart in such dramatic way once that occurs the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients if cardiac fibrosis can be stopped then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk says agellon this would be significant advance in the fight against heart disease the canadian institutes of health research funded the study which appears in plos one source mcgill university the post bile acid might prevent deadly heart scars appeared first on futurity ,no

259,washington dc april 21 2016 because sequenced care plans called clinical pathways now shape the treatment decisions for an increasing number of cancer patients an initiative called project innovation unveiled decoding clinical pathways the first online resource for the public that explains what pathways are and how they affect cancer care today the goal is to help patients understand factors that are shaping their care and if theirs is governed by pathway so they are better prepared to weigh available treatment options with their physician and care team project innovation is campaign to elevate advancements in cancer treatments as national priority coinciding with the publication of the policy paper recommendations for the role of clinical pathways in an era of personalized medicine on april 13 2016 in the american journal of managed care the new module comes at time when the use of pathways is expanding and evolving authored by cancer specialists working with the national patient advocate foundation npaf the paper reports that many hospitals and physician practices now use pathways to translate published medical practice guidelines into the essential steps for treating specific disease or condition when properly designed and implemented these pathways help steer patients and providers to evidence based treatment options that take into account such factors as efficacy and safety along with cost however the npaf paper cautions that pathways can also be oriented more towards cookie cutter approaches that can preempt shared decision making between doctors and patients and interfere with physicians clinical judgement this is of increasing concern as insurance companies implement their own care plans as way to control costs and in some cases pay bonuses to doctors for prescribing on pathway treatments the american society of clinical oncology asco estimates that 60 individual health plans are currently implementing oncology pathways particularly for breast lung and colorectal cancers responding to these developments the online guide introduces the concept of pathways to patients and caregivers most of whom have never heard the term before and serves as primer on the purpose of these care plans the likely benefits of patient focused pathways and the potential limits restrictive versions may impose on available treatment options and patient access to emerging personalized therapies the decoding clinical pathways module is available on the project innovation website at www projectinnovation org for too long the discussion about cancer clinical pathways has been limited to physicians insurance companies and policymakers even though patients are directly affected by how these care plans are designed and what they cover said alan balch phd chief executive officer of the patient advocate foundation paf which manages project innovation our goal is to equip patients and caregivers with user friendly information about pathways so they will know what questions to ask and be prepared to weigh treatment options with their oncologist the need for transparency today clinical pathways are used to manage cancer and other challenging diseases such as congestive heart failure and diabetes when applied to cancer care these protocols are intended to allow oncologists and patients to weigh treatment regimens based on different safety and effectiveness profiles improve outcomes and drive value in the health system conversely some pathways erode the doctor patient relationship and the overall quality of cancer care by limiting or precluding treatment options that may be appropriately personalized to an individual patient which is why the npaf policy paper states patients need to be aware not just of how options on pathways were chosen but also of what other alternatives are viable according to guidelines that may not be listed in the pathway patients can then have an honest consultation with their physician about the various risks benefits and costs associated with each viable option reflecting this position asco published policy statement with nine recommendations to improve clinical pathways and the national patient advocate foundation issued set of guidelines for clinical pathway design and development calling for all clinical pathways to support shared decision making and reflect patients preferences for how to individualize their care however until these recommendations are enacted the online module encourages patients to take action themselves by asking these questions of their oncologist is my treatment determined by clinical pathway if so what treatment options are available through the pathway for my diagnosis and why were they chosen does the pathway include the option of enrolling in clinical trial what happens if the most appropriate treatment is not covered by the pathway are there ways that the health plan will cover this treatment does the insurance plan give financial incentives to the oncology practice for following the pathway further the online module recommends patients and caregivers take advantage of new rules under the affordable care act aca which require insurance companies to make available in concise easy to understand language what their health plans cover ways to get information on the drugs covered through the health plan are to visit the insurer website to review the list of prescriptions the plan includes ask the insurance company to provide the summary of benefits and coverage form that summarizes the key features of the plan such as the covered benefits cost sharing provisions and coverage limitations and exceptions call the insurance company directly to find out what drugs are covered about project innovation launched in june 2014 and spearheaded by the patient advocate foundation paf and national patient advocate foundation npaf project innovation is national movement designed to accelerate the pace of medical discovery in cancer deliver safe and effective breakthrough therapies to patients quickly and save lives through project innovation and its complementary policy

health at the centers for medicare medicaid services romana hasnain wynia s ph program director for addressing disparities at the patient centered outcomes research institute pcori pursuing health equity for the nation accelerating health equity for the nation is this year theme for national minority health month which we mark every april as time to focus on efforts to help all americans achieve the highest level of health they can health equity is challenging goal given how many factors contribute to optimal health but it is goal we can never stop striving to attain there are numerous barriers minorities and other underserved populations face in accessing the health care and those barriers often lead to disparities in health and healthcare outcomes the centers for medicare medicaid services office of minority health and the patient centered outcomes research institute pcori are two of the organizations established by the aca working to address these barriers and accelerate progress toward health equity the cms office of minority health is dedicated to increasing understanding and awareness of health disparities among cms beneficiaries and ensuring that the voices and needs of minority and underserved populations are included in developing implementing and evaluating cms programs and policies it does this through its usa framework which has three interconnected elements that together will help lead to health equity increasingunderstanding and awareness of disparities among its beneficiaries creating and sharingsolutions and accelerating the implementation of effective actions key activities include strengthening cms data and using it to create initiatives that organizations can use to reduce disparities through such specific efforts as the cms equity plan to improve quality in medicare the mapping medicare disparities tool and from coverage to care pcori mandate is to improve the quality and relevance of evidence available to help range of healthcare stakeholders including patients caregivers clinicians employers insurers and policy makers make better informed health decisions it does this by funding research that compares two or more approaches to care to determine what works best for whom under which circumstances based on the outcomes most important to patients pcori authorizing legislation directs it to pay particular attention to health disparities and to include members of minority groups in research whenever possible that one reason why addressing disparities is one of pcori five national priorities for research which govern how pcori awards its research dollars the addressing disparities program now includes substantial portfolio of studies designed to determine how to reduce barriers to effective preventive diagnostic or therapeutic care taking into account individual and group preferences to achieve the best outcomes in each population seeking new approaches both the cms office of minority health and pcori also are concerned with strengthening the healthcare workforce to better serve vulnerable and underserved patient populations this includes initiatives focusing on how to better make use of lay members of healthcare teams who are known for example as community health workers patient navigators and promotores de salud as links between patients communities and the healthcare system cms office of minority health is working on how to support engage and empower these professionals while pcori has funded more than 50 projects that are comparing health outcomes and other aspects of programs that do and don include lay members of healthcare teams one large study involving 30 primary care clinics and almost 1 900 patients compares the effectiveness of clinic based standard of care to collaborative approach that includes community health workers it asks whether the collaborative approach improves hypertension control for racial and ethnic minorities and other groups that experience disparities in this condition delivering health information and services via telecommunications telehealth is another area that both cms and pcori are exploring as means to reduce disparities pcori is currently funding 26 projects on telehealth many of which focus on underserved populations one of these studies compares the effectiveness of telehealth self management approach versus traditional in person care for african american and hispanic latino patients with chronic heart failure in the telehealth intervention care provider contacts the patient weekly via video call the study will measure emergency room use quality of life and other outcomes another cms initiative is looking for ways to expand the use of telehealth in rural areas where health care tends to be less available than elsewhere reducing disparities in chronic disease treatment and outcomes both the cms office of minority health and pcori have commitment to reducing disparities in the treatment of range of illnesses among these is asthma which is more prevalent and severe among african americans and hispanics latinos than among whites as are range of disparities in health outcomes at pcori there are more than dozen projects addressing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma treatment outcomes these include eight studies that compare ways to increase patient and clinician adherence to the national asthma education and prevention program guidelines project teams include patients clinicians insurers health systems community clinics and practices public health departments and patient and caregiver advocacy organizations accelerating health equity the cms office of minority health and pcori are just two of many organizations working to move our nation further along the path to health equity

severe shortness of breath the patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement he was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to bipap hospital course the patient was admitted to the hospitalist service treated with frequent small volume nebulizers treated with iv solu medrol and bipap support for copd exacerbation the patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rate in the low 100s to mid 100s the patient subsequently received diltiazem also received o digoxin the patient subsequently responded well as well received iv antibiotics including levaquin and zosyn the patient made slow but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization the patient subsequently was able to be weaned off bipap during the day but continued bipap at night and will continue with bipap if needed the patient may require sleep study after discharge but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing bipap was simply using supplemental o2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory o2 saturations on one liter per minute

cardiopulmonary bypass cold blood potassium cardioplegia antegrade and retrograde for myocardial protection placement of temporary pacing wires description the patient was brought to the operating room placed in supine position adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced appropriate monitoring lines were placed the chest abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in sterile fashion the greater saphenous vein was harvested from the right upper leg through interrupted skin incisions and was prepared by ligating all branches with 4 0 silk and flushing with vein solution the leg was closed with running 3 0 dexon subcu and running 4 0 dexon subcuticular on the skin and later wrapped median sternotomy incision was made and the left internal mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff at the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine soaked gauze the sternum was closed right carotid incision was made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carried down to and through the platysma the deep fascia was divided the facial vein was divided between clamps and tied with 2 0 silk the common carotid artery takeoff

university hamilton on canada 3 heart center king faisal specialist hospital and research center riyadh saudi arabia received 5 may 2016 accepted 5 may 2016 copyright 2016 tomas palecek et al this is an open access article distributed under the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited according to current european classification cardiomyopathies are defined as myocardial disorders that cannot be explained by coronary artery disease or abnormal loading conditions including valvular and congenital diseases six specific morphological and functional phenotypes are distinguished hypertrophic dilated restrictive and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy together with two unclassified subtypes tako tsubo and left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathies in almost all of these phenotypes inherited forms may be found moreover in some of them for example in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy genetic origin is even rule therefore genetic counseling shall be an integral part of the state of the art care of patients with heart muscle disorders the affected individuals together with their relatives have to be informed about the genetic basis of their disease and the potential risk for other family members detailed cardiac evaluation including ecg and echocardiography in some cases also holter ecg monitoring of first degree relatives is necessary with their further regular follow up if available genetic testing shall be discussed with the patients as it may improve their management as well as enable effective preventive genetic testing in other relatives because the evaluation of morphology and function of the heart especially of the left ventricle is prerequisite for accurate phenotypic characterization of every myocardial disease multimodality imaging approach generally becomes necessary echocardiography is still cornerstone of diagnostic imaging because it is accurate widely available safe and without any contraindications in recent years advanced echo modalities gained clinical role in the follow up of chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy and global longitudinal strain is recommended in the latest european guidelines however the role of cardiac magnetic resonance is increasingly important not only is it the current gold standard for morphological and functional assessment of heart chambers but it has unique opportunity of noninvasive tissue characterization based on evaluation of the presence of myocardial edema hyperemia and necrosis using dedicated sequences cardiac magnetic resonance is capable of diagnosing acute myocarditis with high accuracy late gadolinium enhancement technique is widely used to assess the presence and extent of replacement myocardial fibrosis which appears to be strongly related to the prognosis of affected individuals presence of myocardial fibrosis predisposes to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias sudden cardiac death and progression of left ventricular dysfunction associated with heart failure worsening one also has to mention the significant contribution of various techniques of nuclear medicine for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy it is obvious that increasing knowledge on ethiopathogenesis of various myocardial disorders together with improved diagnostic possibilities shall result in novel therapeutic options complex immunohistochemical and pcr analysis of endomyocardial biopsy specimens allows us to characterize in more detail the presence and type of myocardial inflammation as well as the presence of possible causative infectious agents and select better more targeted treatment of acute myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy with administration of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs or antiviral agents many therapeutic strategies are currently investigated in the field of transthyretin amyloidosis including stabilizers of transthyretin tetramers and gene therapies aimed at suppression of transthyretin expression another important topic is the development of new treatment possibilities that will be able to prevent late sequelae of cytostatic therapy associated with potential cardiotoxic effect in this special issue we are pleased to introduce several interesting original as well as review articles focused on different topics in the field of myocardial diseases two original articles deal with the topic of chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity robinson et al investigated in their experimental study the role of substance in chemotherapy associated death of cardiomyocytes and chemoresistance and nicely showed that aprepitant substance receptor antagonist is able to decrease doxorubicin induced death of cardiomyocytes as well as to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to this drug f yu et al evaluated the use of 2d speckle tracking echocardiography in early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines and radiation therapy their results confirm that this novel imaging modality is more sensitive in detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction than traditional indices of ventricular function such as ejection fraction and thus can be used for long term cardiac surveillance of adult cancer survivors ii three articles review several aspects of inflammation infection related myocardial diseases krejci et al largely summarize our current knowledge on pathophysiology diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory cardiomyopathy with emphasis on accurate evaluation of endomyocardial biopsy samples which is prerequisite for the appropriate choice of subsequent treatment options kuchynka et al nicely overview difficult topic of eosinophilic myocarditis rare disorder necessitating quite rapid diagnosis so early administration of immunosuppressive therapy that may improve the poor prognosis of affected individuals can be initiated in the last article h lumsden and s bloomfield present brilliant review on hiv associated cardiomyopathy which currently represents significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this now chronic disease the authors clearly demonstrate that there is significant need to design clear guidelines for screening protocols and diagnostic criteria for hiv related myocardial disease iii several issues related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are discussed in three articles pudil et al aimed to investigate the significance of vascular endothelial growth factor in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and their results show that increased levels of this substance are associated with structural and functional parameters in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggesting the possibility of its use for more accurate diagnosis k williams et al focused on left atrial function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using magnetic resonance velocity vector imaging they convincingly demonstrate negative impact of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction on left atrial size and function that significantly improves after septal myectomy finally p dimitrow and rajtar salwa review several aspects related to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with emphasis on invasive as well as noninvasive treatment possibilities if the readers will find the presented articles informative and stimulating their interest in myocardial disorders the purpose of this special issue will be completely fulfilled tomas palecek,no

306,newswise april 5 2016 depression is known risk factor for cardiovascular disease but as person depression improves or grows worse their risk for heart disease has remained largely unknown but now new study by researchers at the intermountain medical center heart institute in salt lake city found that effectively treating depression can reduce patient chance of having stroke heart failure heart attack or death in fact effective treatment for depression can reduce patient heart risks to the same level as those who never had short term depression the study found our study shows that prompt effective treatment of depression appears to improve the risk of poor heart health said heidi may phd cardiovascular epidemiologist with the intermountain medical center heart institute with the help of past research we know depression affects long term cardiovascular risks but knowing that alleviating the symptoms of depression reduces person risk of heart disease in the short term too can help care providers and patients commit more fully to treating the symptoms of depression she said the key conclusion of our study is if depression isn treated the risk of cardiovascular complications increases significantly dr may presented her findings at the 2016 american college of cardiology scientific sessions in chicago on april 2 researchers haven completely understood whether short term encounter with depression affects person cardiovascular risk forever or how changes in the symptoms of depression over time affect cardiovascular risk dr may and her team found answers to these questions by studying data compiled in intermountain healthcare depression registry database of more than 100 000 patients there little publically available data about this question dr may said but now with the help of intermountain depression registry we have the ability to start answering some of these difficult questions the intermountain medical center heart research team compiled information from 7 550 patients who completed at least two depression questionnaires over the course of one to two years patients were categorized based on the results of their survey as never depressed no longer depressed remained depressed or became depressed following each patient completion of the last questionnaire patients were followed to see if they had any major cardiovascular problems such as stroke heart failure heart attack or death at the conclusion of the study 4 6 percent of patients who were no longer depressed had similar occurrence of major cardiovascular complications as those who had no depression at all 4 8 percent those who remained depressed however and those who became depressed throughout the study had increased occurrences of major cardiovascular problems their rates were 6 and 6 4 percent respectively treatment for depression resulted in decreased risk of cardiovascular risk that was similar to someone who didn have depression as for the practical application of this study dr may said the research indicates that effective treatment for depression decreases the risk of having cardiovascular problems in the short term but further study is needed to identify exactly what that treatment should include what we ve done thus far is simply observe data that has previously been collected dr may said in order to dig deeper we need do full clinical trial to fully evaluate what we ve observed because of the complex nature of depression it hard to say whether depression leads to risk factors associated with cardiovascular problems such as high blood pressure high cholesterol levels diabetes or lack of exercise or if it the other way around results from the study indicate that changes in depression symptoms may also cause immediate physiological changes in the body which in turn cause major cardiovascular problems to occur in the short term but future studies are needed to further answer these questions other researchers involved in the study include kimberly brunisholz phd benjamin horne phd brent muhlestein md tami bair rn donald lapp md adam wilcox phd and brenda reiss brennan phd aprn intermountain medical center is the flagship facility for the intermountain healthcare system which is based in salt lake city ,no

xxxxxx was brought to the catheterization lab and was anesthetized by anesthesia he was intubated his supplemental oxygen was weaned to 24 on which all of his hemodynamics were obtained the patient was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion including both groins and the right neck xylocaine was administered in the right femoral area 6 french sheath was introduced into the right femoral vein percutaneously without complication 4 french sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery percutaneously without complication 4 french pigtail catheter was introduced and passed to the abdominal aorta dr hayes using the siterite device introduced 5 french sheath into the right internal jugular vein without complication 5 french wedge catheter was introduced through the sheath in the right internal jugular vein and was passed to the left pulmonary artery and further to the left pulmonary capillary wedge position this catheter would not pass to the right pulmonary artery the wedge catheter was removed 5 french ima catheter was then introduced and passed to the right pulmonary artery after right pulmonary artery pressure was measured this catheter was removed the 5 wedge catheter was advanced through the right femoral sheath and was passed to the following chambers or vessels inferior vena cava right atrium left atrium and right ventricle the previously introduced 4 pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta simultaneous right ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured pullback from ascending aorta to descending aorta was then performed simultaneous measurements of right ventricular and descending aortic pressures were measured the wedge catheter was removed 5 french berman catheter was advanced down the glenn shunt to the right pulmonary artery where pullback from right pulmonary artery to glenn shunt was performed an injection was then performed using omnipaque 16 ml at 8 ml per second with the berman catheter positioned in the glenn shunt the 5 french berman was removed 6 french berman was introduced through the right femoral vein sheath and was advanced to the right ventricle right ventriculogram was performed using omnipaque 18 ml at 12 ml per second the berman catheter was pulled back to the inferior vena cava where an inferior vena cavagram was performed using omnipaque 10 ml at 8 ml per second the 4 french pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta and an ascending aortogram was performed using omnipaque 16 ml at 12 ml per second following the ascending angiograms two kidneys and bladder were noted the catheters and sheaths were removed and hemostasis was obtained by direct pressure the estimated blood loss was less than 30 ml and none was replaced heparin was administered following placement of all of the sheaths pulse oximetry saturation pulse in the right foot and ekg were monitored continuously ii pressures left pulmonary artery mean of 11 left capillary wedge mean of 9 main

main pulmonary artery to glenn mean of 12 to mean of 13 right pulmonary artery to glenn mean of 12 to mean of 13 ascending aorta 68 35 to descending aorta 62 35 interpretation right and left pulmonary artery pressures are appropriate for this situation there is gradient of at most 2 mmhg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary arteries to the glenn shunt the left atrial mean pressure is normal right ventricular end diastolic pressure is at most slightly elevated there is trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neo aortic valve stenosis there is roughly 10 mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta on pullback from ascending to descending aorta there is 6 mmhg gradient between the two systemic blood pressure is normal iii oximetry superior vena cava 65 right pulmonary artery 67 left pulmonary artery 65 left atrium 96 right atrium 87 inferior vena cava 69 aorta 86 right ventricle 83 interpretation systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal consistent with normal cardiac output left atrial saturation is fairly normal consistent with normal oxygenation in the lungs the saturation falls passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return as would be expected in this patient iv special procedure none done calculations please see the calculation sheet calculations were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption the _____ saturation used was 67 with pulmonary artery saturation of 65 left atrial saturation of 96 and an aortic saturation of 86 using the above information the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was 0 6 systemic blood flow was 5 1 liters per minute per meter squared pulmonary blood flow was 3 2 liters per minute per meter squared systemic resistance was 9 8 wood units times meter squared which is mildly diminished pulmonary resistance was 2 5 wood units times meter squared which is in the normal range vi angiography the injection to the glenn shunt demonstrates wide open glenn connection the right pulmonary artery is widely patent without stenosis the proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed but does open up near its branch point the right pulmonary artery measures 6 5 the left pulmonary artery measures 3 0 mm the aorta at the diaphragm on later injection was 5 5 mm there is small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe flow to both upper lobes is diminished versus lower lung fields there is normal return of the pulmonary veins from the right with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium there is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein there is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium the right ventriculogram demonstrates heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function the calculated ejection fraction from the lao projection is only mildly diminished at 59 there is no significant tricuspid regurgitation the neo aortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis the ascending aorta is dilated there is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area on some projections there appears to be partial duplication of the aortic arch probably secondary to this patient style of norwood reconstruction there is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobes from collateral blood flow with the left being more opacified than the right the inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium the ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency which is probably catheter induced the coronary arteries are poorly seen again portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated there is faint opacification of the left upper lung from collateral blood flow the above mentioned narrowing of the aortic arch is again noted ,yes

328,a time to exercise reduces risk of day heart failure in 46 study shows that even little exercise day has clear health benefits chairs can kill something could have titled the newspapers of the time the discovery made in 1949 epidemiologist jerry morris this scottish researchers studied two types of workers other than london buses drivers and collectors both were men of similar social environments but the first heart attacks suffered far more often than the latter the difference seemed to be that drivers spent all day while sitting collectors had to move constantly up and down the stairs between the two floors of those vehicles after confirming the correlation had been observed he published their findings in the lancet in what is considered the first scientific evidence of the link between disease and physical inactivity since then many other scientific studies have confirmed that exercise is good for health but how much is necessary to have benefits in study published this week group of swedish researchers after analyzing nearly 40 000 people aged between 20 and 90 years old has concluded that more than one hour of moderate exercise or half hour of intense exercise day can reduce the risk of heart failure by 46 the work which is now published in the journal circulation began in 1997 and included people who then did not suffer heart failure the swedish team of scientists found that more active as was person the lower their risk of autism this study has also confirmed that although greater amount of exercise provides greater benefits even low levels of activity can have positive effects in addition to promoting exercise as part of healthy lifestyle the article authors researchers at the university of uppsala consider designing cities in which walking or cycling move easy and safe can provide great health benefits the explanation for the benefits of physical activity occur among other things because during exercise the muscle contracts more frequently and power increasing blood flow to the arteries this causes subtle changes in the autonomic system that controls the contraction and relaxation of the blood vessels and eventually reduce the number of resting heart rate lowers stress and helps to have heart capable of beating in wider range all these factors reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in addition exercise has been associated with reduction of inflammation which is usually involved in diseases such as arteriosclerosis exercise slims little although the link between exercise and health not arouse too many doubts not so with that between sport and thinning motivation that often drives more people to move the state your arteries in the case of moderate exercise if deemed to walk kilometer consume about 70 calories day five kilometers are traveled that would mean an extra intake of about 350 calories day while quantity is important kilo of fat contains about 7 000 calories thereby maintaining the usual diet weight loss process would be very slow and may produce demotivation for now it seems that the main method to lose weight and stay healthy one is to reduce the number of calories consumed in any case as shown by the swedish study confirming previous work even small amount of exercise that does not make us sylphs can help us be better study led by chi pang wen national health research institutes in taiwan analyzed the physical activity levels of 400 000 taiwan for eight years in this group they found that even people who did just 15 minutes of exercise day were 14 less likely to die in those eight years later and increased their life in three years on average compared to inactive people the article also mentioned that in addition to reducing the risk of heart disease the quarter of an hour of exercise could have avoided one in nine cancer deaths among those who did not perform any physical activity finally they tried to see if what happened was that the most active people had overall healthier lifestyle and it was not when factors such as drinking alcohol or smoking were separated it was observed that the benefits of sport for health were still present more information document dose response relations of total and leisure time physical activity to risk of heart failure prospective cohort study doi 10 1161 circheartfailure 113 001010 source daniel mediavilla http elpais com 3 sep 2014,no

may also have to revisit credit guarantee function it exited some time back in the changed environment ii since 2014 there has been some effort to professionalise dicgc this need to be taken forward iii the anomalous situation arising from commercial banks meeting the cost of the inefficiency of cooperative banks will have to be rectified iv the corporation should apply its mind as to whether continuing the level of deposit insurance should be retained at low of rs one lakh perhaps the threshold should be raised to level to provide cover for at least 50 per cent of bank deposits corporation could consider expanding its ambit to all financial institutions regulated by rbi which are accepting deposits from public this may need differential rates of premia and coordination with regulatory and supervisory arms of rbi g warrier mumbai february 17 2016 stop speculating on rbi apropos rbi guv and never ending speculation economic times money banking february 17 one wonders why et should join the speculators it is common knowledge that even in 2013 when dr raghuram rajan was being tipped for the governor position there were other influential contenders and an opposing school of economists who were spreading all sorts of rumours against dr rajan they were again active during the first half of 2014 gossiping about the possibility of change of guard at mint road post general election it is india good fortune that dr rajan survived the moves against him so far world has acknowledged that the leadership provided by dr rajan in the conduct of rbi affairs has been excellent if india decides and dr rajan accepts on longer term re appointment this paper should not have doubt about dr rajan capability to sort out his personal relationship with the university with which he has had an enduring relationship for the last two decades as any new incumbent governor in rbi takes minimum six months to settle down and the work in progress there now needs continuity in leadership goi may not think in terms of replacing dr rajan in september 2016 and perhaps offer re appointment for longer tenure but reports like this can help gossip mongers and have some impact on the thought processes of economists and media which can influence economy adversely g warrier mumbai business standard february 26 2016 banks health worries this refers to sudhir keshav bhave letter sinking ship february 26 this could be an example of how transparency in sensitive business like banking can spread panic the indian banking sector is not in as bad shape as is being made out by some analysts and external agencies major indian commercial banks including sbi have been able to meet all statutory requirements unlike their corporate co travellers banks are meeting their payment obligations on due dates and in the recent past there have been no bank failures in the commercial banking sector in india part of credit for this should go to the vigilant regulator this is not to argue that all is well as regards functioning of commercial banks there is immediate need to restore the health of the banking system impaired mainly by reluctance of big borrowers to make timely repayment and heavy burden on public sector banks psbs arising from workload and drain on resources in performance of social responsibilities there is no point in arguing now that the overhaul and professionalization of public sector banks psbs should have happened along with bank nationalisation and there should have been regular health checks and ongoing corrections just as health check up does not change the condition of person the re classification of more loans as npas does not alter bank ability to change the need of the hour is to support banks to recover their dues from borrowers who have the capacity to repay infuse professionalism in the banks working and restore the faith in the banking system as private sector banks have failed to perform their responsibilities and are not too willing to grow their share in banking business is less than 30 per cent privatising the existing public sector banks is no solution perhaps goi should consider nationalising entire banking business and restructuring the banking system to serve public interest g warrier mumbai iii self development suggestion shared by doctor worth accepting each individual must take note of the three minutes why is it important three minutes will greatly reduce the number of sudden deaths often this occurs when person who still look healthy has died in the night we hear stories of people suddenly die the reason is that when you wake up at night to go to the bathroom it is often done in rush immediately when stand up the brain lacks blood flow why three minutes is very important in the middle of the night when you are awakened by the urge to urinate for example ecg pattern can change because getting up suddenly the brain which is anaemic can lead to heart failure due to lack of blood hence always practice three minutes which are 1 when waking from sleep lie in bed for the first minute 2 sit in bed for the next minute 3 lower your legs sitting on the edge of the bed for the last minute after three minutes you will not have an anaemic brain and heart will not fail reducing the possibility of fall or sudden death share with family friends loved ones it can occur regardless of age young or old sharing is caring if you already know regard this as refresher copied from an email received from vathsala jayaraman exrbites group __ _ _ ___,no

370,8 weeks 1 day making it to friday seemed like it would never come part of me was impatient and the other part of me hoped it really wouldn come the reality is friday did come went into the fertility office that day doing anything and everything could to not focus on what was going to happen as they called my name took deep breath and hoped for the best the nurse debbie took me back she had been through this with us for the last 9 months but we knew the risks this time were higher as she did the typical check in said to her we are hoping for good news prayed for the first time in 16 years she became tearful hugged me and reminded me that everyone was praying and hoping for good news when the dr came in to start the ultra sound it was almost as if we were pretending things were not that bad katie who had came in place of mike due to work obligations stood next to me she asked do you need me to hold you or something to that affect and remember saying no as my whole world started to spin as the dr looked around focused on finding the heart beat had done this and experienced this enough that knew if it was there would see it panic started to sink in it wasn there looked at the screen and away at the wall million times in full panic the room was so quiet which increased my worry more had to ask do you see the heart beat swear asked 5 times before the response registered he told me there another bloodclot by the placenta and it looks like its pulling down and away why don you sit up and we will talk what does that mean felt like he was walking around giving me answer he continued to tell me that the heart beat was not there the placenta was pulling away because the pregnancy was over the baby stopped growing at 7 weeks 1 day and it appears there was something structural wrong asked about the congestive heart failure he said it appeared that this was why the heart isn beating sat there trying not to cry holding it together as well as could looking away from him because the eye contact would only make it worse three options were given to me one wait to miscarry on my own two take medication to force the miscarriage into place or three have d i originally said didn know what wanted to do the truth is was half between screaming you re lying and the other half wanting to scream get the baby out now it cowardly know but was loosing it and hanging on by this little piece of hope that didn really exist the dr said didn have to decide right then and could call as left debbie stopped me she hugged me and took me into their lab room she gathered tissues while the other nurse april hugged me and sat me down she handed me kit for genetic testing you take the sample if you miscarry at home who even knew such thing existed debbie asked if was doing the medication told her didn know what to do she told me it caused pain and it was hurtful which quickly helped me make up my mind decided to go home and wait if it didn happen on it own would have the c tuesday waiting is the hardest part have been carrying around this kit for little over 2 days every bathroom visit is plagued with fear and the thought of am strong enough to do this kit at home lays firmly on my mind keep going through the emotions they come in waves cry find happiness in simple things cry tears of joy when my little addy comforts me or plays dr and reminds me that your heart is hurt it funny the things kids know but the hurt my heart is feeling is terrible my heart is hurting for me and my husband and our family and feel the weight of the world and still we must wait last night laid in the bathtub submerged in the water had my head down as far as it could go the water to edges of my outer eye laid there numb as the tears flowed they streamed right into the water the relief of them not sliding down my face was somehow relaxing relived the last three weeks relived the fear the heart ache and the excitement that all comes with pregnancy and grieved or started to we don know all that is coming and we don have to but what do know is that we have each other and we are lucky for that we have one happy and healthy little girl and nothing can replace that our fertility journey may not be over and this may just be bump in the road but right now it our lives and we are just trying to survive it wavered back and forth on wether or not to share this post partially because its personal and in part because it a sad reality no one wants to hear but over these years we have met supported and been supported by so many on our first fertility journey and through this one felt it was only fair to be honest that not every story ends with baby although we wish it would we are currently 8 weeks 3 days and still waiting to miscarry as am reminded each time we leave the house and have to grab the kit the reality is our baby is gone and as much as wish that little heart would start beating again its not going to sometimes fear that mine will stop too but the truth is it won and as well as my family will keep going ,yes

372,quote am interested about your comment about how you would prefer the heart disease to the cancer in actual fact am the opposite as we have proved cancer is curable whereas cardiomyopathy is with us for ever would actually prefer the cancer am very happy with my life at the moment but would love to wake up one morning and find that there was drug that could give me that magic fix unfortunately although have been offered the most up to date and innovative treatment out there am still in heart failure and probably will be for the rest of my life you do come to terms with it but you do have to live with it daily for the rest of your life ozchrissy this is my story was diagnosed at age 23 with stage 4 acute lymphoblastic lymphoma had 30 survival chance and it went up to 60 with bone marrow transplant my son was born few weeks early by emergency section so could start chemo immediately became depressed postpartum and everything else going on was in intensive care multiple times when the chemo did it trick and hit remission went for the transplant spent 35 days inpatient in another hospital in chicago illinois had more chemo that took me to the brink of death before they could infuse the bone marrow once finally was able to go home it took several months before had enough strength to take care of my newborn remember just had baby we had hired help and family members living with us to help at night we own construction company and no money coming in if my husband didn work all day couldn go out in public for year if had to go to the grocery store had to wear mask couldn drive for over 6 months it took year for my hair to start growing back and have some permanent alopecia had many side effects from the chemo drugs had little liver trouble after the transplant but that cleared up they had to use the big guns and those gave pretty big side effects won go into the gory details but it was very unpleasant painful and scary at times ironically never actually thought would die just wished would the only thing that kept me going was that little boy had to get back to the worst fear for me was me dying and having my mother in law take care of him lol now for those of you who may have just read this keep in mind that was 23 years ago and the treatment is significantly different now if you know someone who has to have bone marrow transplant it will not be like what you just read thankfully for me actually see chf as livable changed my diet and my expectations of what can accomplish and just enjoy life for however long can am not afraid of dying but don worry am not suicidal either just look at it very differently now my opinion is there are worse things than death aren you sorry you asked ozchrissy really am very happy calm easy going person who just enjoys the simple things in life and m happy that the sun is shining today here ,yes
373,history of present illness was kindly asked to see this patient for transesophageal echocardiogram performance by dr and neurology please see also my cardiovascular consultation dictated separately but essentially this is pleasant 72 year old woman admitted to the hospital with large right mca cva causing left sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry she has been recommended for transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her cns insult discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter who was present at the patient bedside with the patient verbal consent then performed risk benefit alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging which she had already had with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management which the patient was not interested in risks including but not limited to and the patient was aware this was not an all inclusive list of oversedation from conscious sedation risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents risk of oropharyngeal esophageal oral tracheal pulmonary and or gastric perforation hemorrhage or tear the patient expressed understanding of this risk benefit alternative analysis had the opportunity to ask questions which invited from her and her daughter all of which were answered to their self stated satisfaction the patient then stated in clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram procedure the appropriate time out procedure was performed as per medical center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient position physician procedure documentation there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself she received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect she received total of 4 mg of versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect the multi plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition this was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout she was recovered as per the medical center conscious sedation protocol and there were no apparent complications of the procedure findings normal left ventricular size and systolic function lvef of 60 mild

velocity on average is 0 95 sec with deceleration time of 232 milliseconds the proximal aorta is within normal limits annulus 1 19 cm sinuses of valsalva 2 54 cm ascending aorta 2 61 cm the intra atrial septum is identified as are the svc and ivc and these are within normal limits the intra atrial septum is interrogated with color flow as well as agitated d5w and there is no evidence of intracardiac shunting including no atrial septal defect nor patent foramen ovale no pericardial effusion there is mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis seen impression 1 normal left ventricular size and systolic function left ventricular ejection fraction visually estimated at 60 without regional wall motion abnormalities 2 mild left atrial enlargement 3 intracardiac thrombus identified at the base of the left atrial appendage 4 mild mitral regurgitation with two jets 5 mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis compared to the transthoracic echocardiogram done

383,preprocedure diagnosis end stage renal disease postprocedure diagnosis end stage renal disease procedures performed 1 left arm fistulogram 2 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the proximal and distal cephalic vein 3 ultrasound guided access of left upper arm brachiocephalic fistula anesthesia sedation with local complications none condition fair disposition pacu access site left upper arm brachiocephalic fistula sheath size 5 french contrast type jc peg tube 70 contrast volume 48 ml fluoroscopy time 16 minutes indication for procedure this is 38 year old female with left upper arm brachiocephalic fistula which has been transposed the patient recently underwent fistulogram with angioplasty at the proximal upper arm cephalic vein due to stenosis detected on duplex ultrasound the patient subsequently was noted to have poor flow to the fistula and the fistula was difficult to palpate repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated high grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis the patient presents today for left arm fistulogram with angioplasty the risks benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed procedure details the patient was brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table after sedation was administered the left arm was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure the patient was given 1 of iv ancef prior to incision the left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound the cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber there was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis the cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible the skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1 lidocaine solution small incision was made with the 11 blade the cephalic vein then was cannulated with 5 french micropuncture introducer sheath the sheath was advanced over the wire fistulogram was performed which demonstrated high grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis the introducer sheath was then exchanged for 5 french sheath over 0 025 guide wire the sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution 0 025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery 5 french short kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery after crossing the area of stenosis 5 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table this was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmhg pressure and then deflated the balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement however there is still remainder of residual stenosis the 5 mm balloon was placed over the wire again and repeat angioplasty was performed the balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis the glidewire was removed and 0 014 guide wire was then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery 4 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table the 5 french sheath was then exchanged for 6 french sheath the balloon was then placed over the 0 014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmhg the balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire 5 mm 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmhg repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis the patient actually had nice palpable thrill at this point the fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis was performed which demonstrated mild area of stenosis the sheath was removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes after hemostasis was achieved the cephalic vein again was visualized with bevel ultrasound the proximal cephalic vein was then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with 1 lidocaine solution 5 french micropuncture introducer sheath was then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence the 5 french introducer sheath was then exchanged for 5 french sheath the 5 mm 20 mm balloon was placed over 0 035 glidewire across the area of stenosis the balloon was inflated to 14 mmhg the balloon was then deflated and repeat fistulogram was performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results the sheath was then removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes after adequate hemostasis was achieved the area was cleansed in 2x2 and tegaderm was applied the patient tolerated the procedure without any complications was present for the entire case the sponge instrument and needle counts are correct at the end of the case the patient was subsequently taken to pacu in stable condition angiographic findings the initial left arm brachiocephalic fistulogram demonstrated stenosis at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally within the cephalic vein after standard balloon angioplasty there was mild improvement but some residual area of stenosis remained at the anastomosis then postcutting balloon angioplasty venogram demonstrated significant improvement without any evidence of significant stenosis fistulogram of the proximal cephalic vein demonstrated stenosis just prior to the confluence with the left subclavian vein postangioplasty demonstrated excellent results with the standard balloon there was no evidence of any contrast extravasation impression 1 high grade stenosis involving the cephalic vein at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally postcutting balloon and

386,this monthly blog highlights and discuss emerging trends and challenges related to healthcare data and its ever changing life cycle by wendy james rhia pmp the technological advances that have taken place over the past 25 years have been nothing short of phenomenal when reflect on the things have experienced not only in my professional career but the technological advances have seen over the course of my life across the board in all facets of life the effect is staggering from safety oriented upgrades we now take for granted like lap seatbelts and cars equipped with airbags to the improbably yet amazingly real home monitoring system that notifies me whenever there is anything out of the norm from climate control to movement at the front door think about it who would have ever guessed this would be the type of environment we would live in today technology has also been advancing in the healthcare industry suppose someone very close to you just had major health event and has been admitted to the hospital as health information management professionals that are in the business so to speak it could be said we are at slight advantage to know that being admitted to the hospital may not result always in the best outcome and are on the lookout for potential issues whether we like to think it or not we know what can and sometimes does happen for those who are not as informed an incredible amount of trust and faith is given to those who are now caring for your loved one when think about those who are not familiar with healthcare get concerned because many times they do not have an advocate that is independent of those caregivers take for example someone diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which not only presents itself as more enlarged heart on scan but also is somewhat of an irregular heartbeat when this person presents in the emergency room if there is no one there as an advocate for this person this person might receive medications because their blood pressure is not normal these medications then cause the patient to hallucinate which then might cause misdiagnosis by the caregivers who are unfamiliar with this person patient best defense is many times loved one who remains diligent and passionate asking questions each step of the way on the journey through the hospitalization what may be normal for your loved one is not normal for someone else so how can our health information actually save life how many times have you entered in your demographics in triplicate during the same episode of care for the same facility we document our medications we document our date of birth we document our health history we document our allergies we document our past surgeries we document our known problems but who really reads it to the caregiver it just data but to me or my loved one it my health story one that am passionate about one that want to protect not every patient is going to have an advocate available to them at all times while in the hospital for those who do they are lucky there have been many times having that loved one in the room with you might have saved your life perhaps they questioned medicine or questioned why certain procedure was necessary one of the challenges today patients face is the general lack of continuity of care limited knowledge of the patient history or the robotic response to automated and or scheduled orders without consideration of the current conditions having an advocate present is sometimes nothing short of being lifesaver the ability to provide such an ardent advocate for each patient is not currently possible or feasible but what if it was new smart phone application developed by larry trach at emrconnect is currently being tested that will provide giant step forward in helping patient safely navigate hospital stay this application will monitor data streams from the hospital electronic health record from three different subject areas registration and admit discharge transfer adt messages provider access of your patient record clinical results like labs vital signs and other pertinent documentation registration and adt monitoring after registration is completed you will be able to visually verify your demographic information guarantor and emergency contacts insurance information advance directive and providers assigned to your case registration system is susceptible to human and interface errors such as registration overlays bad medical record or account combines and system interface errors if any of your key demographics change during the course of your stay you would be immediately alerted monitoring provider access not all damage or injury is result of medical malpractice inappropriate access to your health information by someone who is not on your care team can be signal for identify theft loss of confidentiality and more you will be able to see all the providers that accessed your record what their role was and what they did on your behalf if you question particular activity or access review request can be sent directly to the designated privacy officer or security team clinical monitoring for predicting harmful conditions vital signs and labs can be good predictors of vital stress over sedation early detection of sepsis and many other conditions or adverse events each time new result arrives it will be reviewed scored and combined with other key measures risk factors and co morbidities because of the dynamic and sometimes chaotic nature of activities on the nursing unit it is easy to miss key piece of new information such as critical lab value not to mention the latencies between time of care and time of documentation the monitoring application would allow patient or the patient designee to receive messages about their healthcare there would be remote access for monitoring and message capability thus improving communication among all of the appropriate caregivers if we can wire our homes to provide us with up to the minute information in the interest of safety and security then we should certainly be able to apply this same technology to healthcare after all there is nothing more important than saving life

and after the procedure 3 mediastinal lymph node sampling including levels 4r and 7 4 tube thoracostomy x2 including 19 french blake and 32 french chest tube 5 multiple chest wall biopsies and excision of margin on anterior chest wall adjacent to adherent tumor anesthesia general endotracheal anesthesia with double lumen endotracheal tube disposition of specimens to pathology both for frozen and permanent analysis findings the right middle lobe tumor was adherent to the anterior chest wall the adhesion was taken down and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion was sent for pathologic analysis the final frozen pathology on this entire area returned as negative for tumor additional chest wall abnormalities were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis and these all returned separately as negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue several other biopsies were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall all of the biopsy sites were additionally marked with hemoclips the right middle lobe lesion was accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe estimated blood loss less than 100 ml condition of the patient after surgery stable history of procedure this patient is well known to our service he was admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on april 4 2007 was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident although he had markedly difficult airway the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi no abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree and based on this the decision was made to proceed with the surgery the patient was kept in the supine position and the single lumen endotracheal tube was removed and double lumen tube was placed following this the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded sterile duraprep preparation on the right chest was placed sterile drape around that was also placed the table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double lumen endotracheal tube marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision the incisions for the vats right middle lobectomy included small 1 cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula the camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which 5 mm 30 degree scope was used third incision was an anterior port which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space and the third incision was utility port which was 4 cm long incision which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein all of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure the initial incision was the camera port through which under direct visualization an additional small 5 mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port these two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port through these three incisions the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative the right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall this area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis this also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue but no tumor cells based on this the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy following this the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed the middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45 mm endogia stapler following division of the right superior pulmonary vein the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified initially this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus this was encircled and divided with blue load stapler with 45 mm endogia following division of this the pulmonary artery was easily identified two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe these were individually divided with vascular load after encircling with right angle clamp the vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk and following this an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus this was divided with blue load stapler 45 mm endogia following division of this the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe following complete division of the fissure the lobe was put into an endogia bag and taken out through the utility port following removal of the right middle lobe meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4r area as well as the 7 lymph node package node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified therefore none were taken the patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted 19 french blake was placed into the posterior apical position and 32 french chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position following this the patient lung was allowed to reexpand fully and the patient was checked for air leaking once again following this all the ports were closed with 2 0 vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue and 3 0 vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4 0 monocryl suture was used to close the skin in running subcuticular fashion the patient tolerated the procedure well was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition ,yes

tumor and left lower lobe lung wedge resection to pathology indications for procedure the patient is 79 year old male who began to experience back pain approximately 2 years ago which increased chest ray and ct scan revealed 3 cm 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening biopsy was performed at an outside hospital kaiser and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma the patient had metastatic workup which was negative including brain mri and bone scan the bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor the patient has significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease hypertension non insulin dependent diabetes longstanding atrial fibrillation anemia and hypercholesterolemia he and his family were apprised of the high risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained procedure in detail the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position the patient was intubated with double lumen endotracheal tube intravenous antibiotics were given foley catheter was placed the patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion an incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass the skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery good hemostasis was obtained the tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions which were taken down with combination of blunt and sharp dissection the thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly it was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected the ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect the ribs 7 8 9 and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips the chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly it was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement inferiorly the diaphragm was divided to provide margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor the spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected inferiorly the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace the dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine the left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the gia 75 were used to perform wedge resection of the left lower lobe which provided complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung 2 0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection posteriorly the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately t8 and t9 where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies the ribs were disarticulated closed to or at their articulations with the spine bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with combination of clips and electrocautery there was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta the posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as specimen to pathology for permanent section the specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room hemostasis was obtained the vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with series of figure of 8 1 ethibond sutures this produced satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension single 32 french chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly this was secured with 1 silk suture the gore tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect series of 1 prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually the resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate the serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure of 8 0 vicryl the latissimus was reapproximated with two 1 vicryl placed in running fashion of note two 10 jp drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall the subcutaneous tissues were closed with running 3 0 vicryl suture and the skin was closed with 4 0 monocryl the wounds were dressed the patient was brought from the operating room directly to the north icu intubated in

406,hi motherrunner completely understandable to be apprehensive of the unknown being on doxorubicin cyclophosphamide as first set of chemotherapy was lot harder on me so being on trastuzumab paclitaxel was little easier but still had it own side effect but manageable had feeling of diminish appetite but not to the extreme ate small but frequent rinse my mouth everyday with baking soda and salt to ensure not to have any mouth sores tried to move as much as can on daily basis did feel tired nauseated drank frequently lots of water soreness in the muscles joints numbness in the bottom of my feet hands did frequent stretching yoga poses unfortunately for some odd reason was the small percentage who run into heart issues due to herceptin and luckily enough was part of research team who monitored my heart since the beginning of my treatment with ac as soon as they found out had congestive heart failure they put me on medication and stop the herceptin for 2 weeks and my heart went back to normal moving is key take it day by day and m sure you will kick it ass am scheduled for my surgery on april 21 ,yes

408,stem cell technique predicts patients likely to have severe chemo reaction medical news today small minority of patients treated with common chemotherapy drug develop severe heart damage but there is currently no way of identifying in advance who they might be now researchers have developed method using reprogrammed stem cells derived from the patient own skin cells that predicts whether they fall into this group the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin brand name adriamycin is very effective against wide range of cancers including breast cancer and childhood leukemia but in around 8 of patients it causes cardiotoxicity where the heart muscles become damaged and in severe cases leads to heart failure writing in the journal nature medicine researchers from stanford university stanford ca and northwestern university chicago il explain how they developed the stem celltechnique and then went on to discover the likely genetic reasons for the differences in reaction to the drug ,no
409,hey guys so ve been trying to do as much research as can before making the post but may as well make some inquiries since m hitting an impasse background had 49cc motor that basically soft seized and was getting terrible compression eventually opened it up 6 months later now that ve got little bit of time and found that the piston certainly had its heyday is pretty much toast now as you can see in the pic the original thread made is here but ll bring you guys up to speed in this thread either way so you don have to read it all viewtopic php 2 27303 my old motor was getting super low compression 30 on my oh so world renound harbor freight compression tester so instead of getting new 49cc cylinder opted to upgrade so bought an athena 70cc kit and dellorto 17 5mm phbn carb with set of jets from 80 to 88 which have not installed yet and 5 br9hs plugs to chop yesterday we removed the old cylinder and installed the new 70cc athena one disclaimer however we installed the new cylinder piston etc properly lubed up and getting 0 9mm squish as per the instructions but we did not install this rubber ring here because we could not find place for it and it wasn covered in the instructions at all in videos for other cylinder installations the head has place for this rubber ring and you lube it up and place it there when installing the cylinder but the head on my cylinder had no place for it trust me checked every possible way that it could sit there so we installed everything without it and it has the proper squish and everything but of course it seems like probably misunderstood where it supposed to go and therefore put it all together without ever realizing was skipping step however we did everything as legitimately as possible so m not sure which step would ve missed maybe it a totally critical piece maybe it a total non issue piece literally have no idea so the cylinder is installed the reeds are installed the new phbn carb is installed the new spark plug is installed etc tried getting it to start without the exhaust attached which later realize may have been mistake so attached the exhaust but not the airbox and have continued to try and get this thing started thus far to no avail don have an electric start so m working solely with kick starts used the compression tester again and it would give me reading of 90psi as to be expected from hf compression tester but after more rigorous kicking it moves up to 110 115psi with more rigorous kicking honestly think could get it up to 120 but the return spring on my kick starter is super shitty weak and m small man so it physically exhausting to keep kicking and kicking in this hot weather so think my compression is fine with the new motor when we installed the phbn carb we used the needle assembly from the stock carb also of dellorto manufacture because don know how to change them out they appeared to be about the same though update ignore the underlined text replaced the full carb the air screw is set at 1 and 1 3 screws out and m not sure what the fuel screw is at currently planned to tune the carb after it got running but do you guys think need to tune the carb ahead of time just to get the scooter running haven touched the jets or the float at all on the new carb believe the carb is getting fuel since the hose is wet when pull it off the carb the oil line however is dry thus far and m pretty sure need to get new oil hose because the one have is cracking really badly at the mouth and need to zip tie it to keep it on the carb nipple don have any more slack on the hose otherwise would just cut the end and reattach it so need to replace the hose believe so ve ordered parts 10 and 11 from here http www jerseyshorepowersports com veh 175798 it may not be the right hose but m hoping it will be in the meantime with the zip tied hose how do get the oil to travel into the carb until the time of writing this post think it has been attached too loosely and just now went out and affixed it more firmly with the zip tie for better seal however temporary how do bleed the line to get rid of the air in the tube the manual mentions bleeding the autopump but when unscrew that bleed screw the oil just comes out right there by the fan cover and not down the hose at the carb end obviously given the physics of the bleed screw location so how do get oil down the line m hoping haven done any damage yet by kicking it over so many times without realizing the oil line wasn affixed firmly read in this post viewtopic php 39 23158 that it mentions applying vacuum to the petcock to prime the carb and m not sure how to do that all of the pictures in the tutorial have expired m hoping the scooter isn starting simply because haven done enough to prime the new parts for proper ignition but because m in an area where haven seen much literature m no longer sure how to diagnose the situation haven been able to find whole lot of information about what specifically need to do once the new parts are completely installed the good news is that the issue ought not to be problem with cylinder wear since it brand new and has never fired before and once it running ll tune the carb so that wear on the engine is at minimum but can do that yet since can even get it to start read in this thread viewtopic php 39 23516 that it took op over 100 kicks to get it started so don know if my issue is because haven given it enough kicks trust me when say was kicking the stool out of that kick starter on the new motor or what but would guess that it because m skipping some important step for prepping new engine setup any ideas thanks for reading guys last edited by hunter on sun jun 19 2016 3 08 pm edited 10 times in total ,no
410,preoperative diagnoses progressive exertional angina three vessel coronary artery disease left main disease preserved left ventricular function postoperative diagnoses progressive exertional angina three vessel coronary artery disease left main disease preserved left ventricular function operative procedure coronary artery bypass grafting cabg x4 grafts performed lima to lad left radial artery from the aorta to the pda left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal indications for procedure the patient is 74 year old gentleman who presented with six month history of progressively worsening exertional angina he had positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved lv function he was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries findings during the procedure the aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits radial artery graft was smaller sized conduit otherwise good quality all distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present the smallest target was the pda which was about 1 5 mm in size all the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems he was transferred on neo synephrine nitroglycerin precedex drips cross clamp time was 102 minutes bypass time was 120 minutes details of the procedure the patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table after he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right ij triple lumen catheter and cordis catheter right radial line foley catheter tee probes were placed and interfaced appropriately the patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest after prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion proper time out was conducted and site identification was performed and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed left internal mammary artery was taken down simultaneously left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques simultaneously endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques subsequent to harvest the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure heparin was given pericardium was opened and suspended during the takedown of the left internal mammary artery it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally only limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery pericardium was opened and suspended pursestring sutures were placed aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass with satisfactory flow the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia an initial dose of about 1500 ml was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain good arrest and to protect the heart pda was exposed first the right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation even in the pda calcification was noted in spotty fashion arteriotomy on the pda was performed in soft area and 1 5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions end radial to side pda anastomosis was constructed using running 7 0 prolene next the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed arteriotomy was performed an end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7 0 prolene this graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and diamond shaped side to side anastomosis was constructed using running 7 0 prolene next slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and lima was accommodated in the slit on its way to the lad lad was exposed arteriotomy was performed an end lima to side lad anastomosis was constructed using running 7 0 prolene lima was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4 mm punch two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6 0 prolene the patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de airing maneuvers were performed following this the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity temporary pacing wires were placed blake drains were placed in the left chest the right chest as well as in the mediastinum left chest blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed after an adequate period of rewarming during which time temporary pacing wires were also placed the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems with satisfactory hemodynamics good lv function on tee and baseline ekg heparin was reversed using protamine decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation hemostasis was assured mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves heavy vicryl for musculofascial closure and monocryl for subcuticular skin closure dressings were applied the patient was transferred to the icu in stable condition he tolerated the procedure well all counts were correct at the termination of the procedure cross clamp time was 102 minutes bypass time was 120 minutes the patient was transferred on neo synephrine nitroglycerin and precedex drips ,yes
411,thanks for your question on healthcare magic can understand your concern yes you should definitely rule out heart diseases like heart failure and coronary artery disease cad in your case for your symptoms you are hypertensive patient and having borderline diabetes so you are at risk of heart diseases and your symptoms are seen with heart diseases so consult cardiologist and get done 1 blood pressure monitoring 2 ecg 3 2d echo 4 stress test you may need diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs strict control of hypertension and diabetes are also needed don worry you will be alright consult cardiologist and discuss all these hope have solved your query will be happy to help you further wish you good health thanks ,no
412,preoperative diagnosis left pleural effusion postoperative diagnosis left hemothorax procedure thoracentesis procedure in detail after obtaining informed consent and having explained the procedure to the patient he was sat at the side of stretcher in the emergency department his left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion xylocaine 1 was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 ml blood this blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice halfway during the procedure the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s therefore we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place at that time proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure overall besides the described episode the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards we took another chest ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain ct in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not ,yes

416,results from vericel positive phase 2b ixcell dcm clinical trial of ixmyelocel presented today at acc and published in the lancet patients treated with ixmyelocel had 37 percent reduction in clinical events compared to placebo cambridge mass april 4 globe newswire vericel corporation nasdaq vcel leading developer of patient specific expanded cellular therapies for the treatment of severe diseases and conditions today announced the presentation and publication of results from the company phase 2b ixcell dcm clinical study of ixmyelocel in patients with advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy dcm the data were presented today by timothy henry d at the late breaking clinical trial session and press conference at the american college of cardiology acc 65th annual scientific session and published in the lancet dr henry is director of cardiology at cedars sinai heart institute principal investigator of the study and co author of the lancet publication the ixcell dcm study met its primary endpoint of demonstrating reduction in the total number of all cause deaths cardiovascular hospitalizations or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the 12 months following treatment with ixmyelocel compared to placebo said dr david recker vericel chief medical officer from safety perspective the incidence of adverse events including serious adverse events in patients treated with ixmyelocel was comparable to or lower than patients in the placebo group we are very excited about the results of this clinical trial and greatly appreciate the contributions of the patients investigators and dedicated personnel who participated in this study we have major unmet need in the treatment of class iii and iv heart failure said amit patel d director of clinical regenerative medicine and associate professor of surgery at the university of utah and the chair of the ixcell dcm steering committee based on these positive results we are encouraged that ixmyelocel has the potential if approved to represent an important new option for patients with class iii and class iv heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy the ixcell dcm clinical trial is multicenter randomized 1 1 double blind placebo controlled phase 2b study to assess the efficacy safety and tolerability of ixmyelocel compared to placebo vehicle control when administered via transendocardial catheter based injections to subjects with end stage heart failure due to ischemic dcm total of 126 patients with new york heart association nyha class iii or iv heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either ixmyelocel or placebo and 114 patients were treated at 28 sites in the united states all clinical events in the primary and secondary endpoints were adjudicated in blinded fashion by an independent adjudication committee the trial met its primary endpoint with patients in the ixmyelocel group having 37 percent reduction in all cause deaths cardiovascular hospitalizations or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the 12 months following treatment compared to the placebo group 0 0344 the primary endpoint was driven by reduction in both all cause deaths and cardiovascular hospitalizations in the primary endpoint without procedure related events three percent of patients in the ixmyelocel group died and 38 percent had cardiovascular hospitalizations one or more times compared to 14 percent and 47 percent respectively in the placebo group all deaths were adjudicated to be due to cardiovascular causes with respect to the secondary endpoints of the trial the components of the primary endpoint were also analyzed using the win ratio in hierarchical manner to incorporate both the incidence and timing of the endpoint components the win ratio result of 1 56 showed that more often ixmyelocel was the winner in that the time to death left ventricular assist device placement heart transplantation or time to cardiovascular hospitalization was shorter for placebo treated patients but this difference did not reach statistical significance the time to first event was longer in the ixmyelocel group compared to placebo but was not statistically significant there were no significant structural changes in left ventricle cavity size or left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by echocardiogram in either the ixmyelocel or placebo groups both treatment groups had an improvement in the nyha class and six minute walk test with no statistical difference between the groups at month 12 using last observation carried forward overall there were fewer adverse events and serious adverse events in the ixmyelocel group compared to the placebo group adverse events included those typically related to catheterization or injection procedures the ixcell dcm trial showed statistically significant reduction in clinical events driven by both cardiac mortality and cardiac hospitalizations at 12 months compared to placebo these results are consistent with two previous phase 2a studies which showed that ischemic dcm patients treated with ixmyelocel experienced fewer major adverse cardiovascular events during follow up compared to control patients vericel will host webcast at 12 00pm et on tuesday april 5 2016 to review ixmyelocel and the phase 2b ixcell dcm trial results dr gary schaer d of rush university medical center and member of the ixcell dcm steering committee will present an overview of the results from the ixcell dcm clinical trial and dr ross tubo vericel chief scientific officer will present additional background information on ixmyelocel and describe the potential benefits of expanded multicellular

427,for some patients with type 2 diabetes treatment with intense blood lowering medication may do more harm than good this is according to new study published in the bmj for some patients with type 2 diabetes antihypertensive medication may raise the risk of cardiovascular death the researchers including mattias brunstr of the department of public health and clinical medicine at ume university in sweden found that antihypertensive drugs may increase the risk of cardiovascular death for diabetes patients with systolic blood pressure under 140 mm hg while almost 1 in 2 people in the us have high blood pressure or hypertension the condition affects around 2 in 3 americans with diabetes putting them at higher risk of stroke heart disease and other cardiovascular problems as such people with diabetes are often prescribed medication to help lower blood pressure the american diabetes association recommend systolic blood pressure target of less than 140 mm hg for patients with type 2 diabetes the most common form of diabetes though target of less than 130 mm hg is recommended for some patients if it can be achieved safely for their study brunstr and his colleague bo carlberg also of the department of public health and clinical medicine at ume set out to investigate whether the effects of antihypertensive medication vary dependent on patient blood pressure prior to treatment increased cardiovascular death risk for some diabetes patients the team conducted meta analysis of 49 randomized controlled trials involving total of 73 738 participants that looked at the cardiovascular outcomes of people with diabetes who were receiving blood pressure lowering medication the vast majority of participants had type 2 diabetes and subjects were followed up for at least 12 months the team looked at the blood pressure of participants before treatment and assessed the cardiovascular effects of antihypertensive medication the researchers found that participants whose blood pressure was higher than 140 mm hg before treatment had reduced risk of stroke heart attack heart failure and all cause mortality among subjects whose blood pressure was less than 140 mm hg prior to antihypertensive treatment however no cardiovascular benefits were identified in fact these participants were found to be at greater risk of cardiovascular death commenting on the findings brunstr says our study shows that intensive blood pressure lowering treatment using antihypertensive drugs may be harmful for people with diabetes and systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm hg the researchers stress that because most study participants had type 2 diabetes their results may not apply to people with type 1 diabetes or those with diabetes who have normal blood pressure additionally they point out that anti hypertensive medication is crucial to most people with diabetes who have systolic blood pressure above 140 mm hg in practice it is important to remember that undertreatment of high blood pressure is bigger problem than overtreatment adds brunstr still the team says the findings could have important implications for clinical guidelines for diabetes patients with high blood pressure noting that many countries are due to review such guidelines in the next few years it has been discussed to recommend even lower blood pressure levels for people with diabetes maybe as low as 130 says brunstr we are hoping that our study which shows potential risks of such aggressive blood pressure lowering treatment will come to influence these guidelines earlier this month medical news today reported on study detailing the creation of insulin producing mini stomachs which researchers say could offer new cellular therapy for diabetes click the stars to rate this article type 2 diabetes blood pressure drugs may be harmful for some patients public patient 4 based on 1 rating health professionals,no

439,the death of partner may actually break your heart new research suggests the study found that those who lose partner are at an increased risk of developing an irregular heartbeat also known as atrial fibrillation which in itself is risk factor for stroke and heart failure the researchers noted that the risk appears to be greater in younger people after the death of their loved one compared to older generations what more the risk of an irregular heartbeat also increases when the death is least expected danish researchers collated data from almost 89 000 people diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat between 1995 and 2014 and compared it to 886 000 healthy people total of 17 478 of those diagnosed with atrial fibrillation had lost their partner compared to 168 940 of the comparison group after taking into account number of lifestyle factors the researchers calculated that the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat for the first time was 41 higher among those who had been bereaved the authors cautioned that no cause and effect can be inferred from the observational study but said that bereavement is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease mental illness and even death the loss of partner is considered one of the most severely stressful life events and is likely to affect most people independently of coping mechanisms the study authors said according to the press association in this large population based study the severely stressful life event of losing partner was associated with transiently increased risk of atrial fibrillation which lasted for about one year the elevated risk was especially high for those who were young and those who lost relatively healthy partner bereavement is major life event which is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease mental illness and death the underlying causal mechanisms for the association between the loss of partner and af is unclear but acute stress may possess direct arrhythmogenic properties by alternating autonomic control influencing heart rate variability and enhancing pro inflammatory cytokines maureen talbot senior cardiac nurse at the british heart foundation added the bereavement of partner is devastating event in anyone life but the effect can be even worse when death is sudden or premature our research has shown how emotional stress can have an adverse effect on the heart but this study also highlights significant physical effect greater risk of developing atrial fibrillation when recently bereaved this risk appears even greater the more sudden the death or younger that person is studies to increase understanding of the cause of this finding are needed but it is important to ensure the newly bereaved regardless of their age are monitored and supported by their loved ones and to see their gp if they experience any symptoms this feed and its contents are the property of the huffington post and use is subject to our terms it may be used for personal consumption but may not be distributed on website ,no

468,so ve had chest pain for about 2 weeks now but it getting worse ve been short of breath getting hot flashes and really super nauseous also my appetite is gone let me give bit of history here am 26 but been extremely sedentary for the past 8 years haven really done much of anything so ve gotten like no exercise at all also have had an awful diet eating lots of fast food am not overweight at all in fact probably need to gain some my cardiologist and the er doesn seem to take this very seriously due to my age because they think it nearly impossible to have clogged arteries at my age couldn my lifestyle and diet make this possible though have had few tests which will list below ekgs some come back abnormal one even said something about st depression but both the doctors and people here said it was nothing to worry about echocardiogram showed slightly reduced ejection fraction of 48 otherwise normal nuclear stress test the test showed normal perfusion blood tests last time was at the er weeks ago they checked cbc metabolic panel troponin lipase dimer thyroid troponin 0 01 ng ml they said it normal holter monitor did this before the chest pain started but it came back okay my question is could with all these tests could be having angina pain is it possible that the nuclear stress test missed blockage or is this 100 confirmed to not be the heart at this point my symptoms seem to be getting worse which is why m very concerned they don want to do an angiogram on me because m 26 just don know what to do next also this isn a gi problem because ve been to the gastroenterologist too m really scared these are symptoms leading up to heart attack and that my arteries are clogged am 26 male 5 11 145 pounds white ,yes
469,history the patient is 9 year old born with pulmonary atresia intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids he also has vacterl association with hydrocephalus as an infant he underwent placement of right modified central shunt on 05 26 1999 he underwent placement of bidirectional glenn shunt pulmonary artery angioplasty takedown of the central shunt pda ligation and placement of 4 mm left sided central shunt on 08 01 2006 he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt repeat catheterization on 09 25 2001 demonstrated elevated glenn pressures and significant collateral vessels for which he underwent embolization he then underwent repeat catheterization on 11 20 2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessels blood pressures were found to be 13 mmhg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2 6 3 1 wood units on 03 22 2004 he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac fontan with placement of an 8 mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation repeat catheterization on 09 07 2006 demonstrated mildly elevated fontan pressures in the context of widely patent fontan fenestration and intolerance of fontan fenestration occlusion the patient then followed conservatively since that time the patient is undergoing repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for fontan fenestration occlusion as well as consideration for tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract procedure after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia the patient was prepped and draped cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets vascular entry was by percutaneous technique and the patient was heparinized monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg continuous pulse oximetry and cycled cuff blood pressures in addition to intravascular pressures using 7 french sheath 6 french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery as well as the superior vena cava this catheter was then exchanged for 5 french vs catheter of distal wire apposition of the right pulmonary artery over which the wedge catheter was advanced the wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins left atrium and left ventricle using 5 french sheath 5 french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ascending aorta and left ventricle attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle the catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve both angiographically as well as equal guidance left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic balloon valvoplasty was performed using ranger 4 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure echocardiogram which showed no significant change in the appearance of tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7 french flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium there was disappearance of mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon the balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve final angioplasty was performed utilizing 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of distinctive waste echocardiogram however demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned attention was then directed to fontan fenestration balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in fontan pressures from 12 mmhg to 15 mmhg with less than 10 fall in calculated cardiac index the angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated large fenestration measuring 6 6 mm in diameter with length of 8 mm 7 french flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration 10 mm amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk once the stable device configuration was confirmed device was released from the delivery catheter hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery left coronary artery superior vena cava inferior vena cava and right ventricle after angiography two normal appearing renal collecting systems were visualized the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition there were no complications discussion oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation there was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow the right pulmonary veins were fully saturated left pulmonary veins were not entered there was fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to right to left shunt across the fontan fenestration mean fontan pressures were 12 mmhg with 1 mmhg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an wave similar to the normal left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 11 mmhg left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmhg systolic gradient pressure pull back to the ascending aorta phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal the calculated systemic flow was normal pulmonary flow was reduced to the qt qs ratio of 0 7621 pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 wood units angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle the left coronary angiogram showed left dominant system with brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries there was communication to the right sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery as well as the central pulmonary artery diameter of which was augmented by the glenn anastomosis and the fontan anastomosis there was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration there is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow the branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic levo phase contrast returned into the heart appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility angiogram with injection in the fontan showed widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries following the device occlusion of fontan fenestration the fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmhg with 3 mmhg mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery there was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95 the calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with qt qs ratio of 0 921 angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed stable device configuration with good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the fontan with no protrusion into the fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to fontan flow an ascending aortogram that showed left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and multiple small residual aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the intercostal arteries small degree of contrast returned to the heart initial diagnoses 1 pulmonary atresia 2 vacterl association 3 persistent sinusoidal right ventricle to the coronary communications 4 hydrocephalus prior surgeries and interventions 1 systemic to pulmonary shunts 2 right bidirectional glenn shunt 3 revision of the central shunt 4 ligation and division of patent ductus arteriosus 5 occlusion of venovenous and arterial aortopulmonary collateral vessels 6 extracardiac fontan with the fenestration current diagnoses 1 favorable fontan hemodynamics 2 hypertensive right ventricle 3 aneurysm membranous ventricular septum with mild left ventricle outflow tract obstruction 4 patent fontan fenestration current intervention 1 balloon dilation tricuspid valve attempted and failed 2 occlusion of fontan fenestration management he will be discussed at

480,history of present illness the patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response partially due to medications at least when first saw him in the office on 01 11 06 he is now 77 years old he is being seen on the seventh floor the patient is in room 7607 the patient has history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable since it engulfed the porta hepatis the workup began with gi bleeding he was seen in my office on 01 11 06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema nonocclusive dvt was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein both legs were edematous and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50 the patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated additional information on the echocardiogram where grossly dilated left atrium moderately severely dilated right atrium the rhythm was as stated before atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip there was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation mild pulmonic insufficiency the ejection fraction was considered low normal since it was estimated 50 to 54 the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia the leg edema improved while lying down suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present the patient who was diabetic received consultation by dr he was also chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ace inhibitors the atrial fibrillation was slow and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time as matter of fact they were discontinued now the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia allergies the patient has no known drug allergies his diabetes was suspected to be complicated with neuropathy due to tingling in both feet he received his immunizations with flu in 2005 but did not receive pneumovax social history the patient is married he had 1

493, dr hyman my father has heart disease his father did too and m obviously concerned about my own heart writes this week house call what can do to prevent heart disease most importantly please know while genetics contributes to some degree many other factors completely within your control can contribute to or reverse heart disease genetics loads the gun but environment pulls the trigger the way you eat how much you exercise how you manage stress and your exposure to environmental toxins all contribute to things like high cholesterol high blood pressure high blood sugar and of course heart disease the current way doctors treat heart disease is misguided because they treat the risk factors not the causes to think we can treat heart disease by lowering cholesterol lowering blood pressure and lowering blood sugar with medication is like mopping up the floor while the sink overflows instead we need to ask what causes these risk factors like high blood pressure high blood sugar or abnormal cholesterol in the first place spoiler alert these are not medication deficiencies we treat these problems with medication but studies have increasingly shown that treating these risk factors has only little benefit or none at all research shows changing your lifestyle can be more powerful intervention to prevent heart disease than any medication the epic study published in the archives of internal medicine studied how 23 000 people adhered to four simple behaviors not smoking exercising 3 5 hours week eating healthy diet and maintaining healthy weight adhering to those four behaviors alone prevented 93 percent of diabetes 81 percent of heart attacks 50 percent of strokes and 36 percent of all cancers likewise the interheart study published in the lancet in 2004 followed 30 000 people in 52 countries researchers found changing lifestyle could prevent at least 90 percent of all heart disease other research shows lifestyle intervention becomes more effective than almost any other traditional medical intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease hypertension heart failure stroke cancer diabesity and deaths from all causes your environment in turn changes gene expression subsequently modulating inflammation oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction these are the reasons we get sick and develop heart disease along with other problems that actually good news addressing and fixing the root causes benefits most chronic disease these modifications will make you feel alive and healthy without the side effects of medication occasionally will use medications if feel patient shows strong genetic predisposition for heart disease or if significant heart disease already exists under those circumstances carefully weigh medication risks and benefits at the same time most patients can achieve the benefits of most medications through lifestyle changes dr david jenkins from the university of toronto compared treatment with statin drugs the number one cholesterol medication with diet rich in viscous fiber almonds soy and plant sterols researchers in this study found that while they created almost equal benefits diet became more effective to lower inflammation and homocysteine risk marker for heart disease ve likewise had patients lower their cholesterol sometimes over 100 points simply by incorporating positive dietary and lifestyle changes simply put preventative medicine becomes the best form of medicine these 10 simple modifications can go long way to preventing or reversing heart disease eat healthy diet increase healthy whole foods rich in nutrients and phytonutrients plant molecules aim for at least 8 to 10 servings of colorful fruits and vegetables every day these foods are loaded with disease fighting vitamins minerals fiber antioxidants and anti inflammatory molecules steady your blood sugar studies show blood sugar imbalances contribute to heart disease stabilize your blood sugar with protein healthy fat and healthy carbohydrates at every meal never eat carbohydrates alone and avoid processed sugars with carbohydrates discuss this more in depth in the blood sugar solution 10 day detox diet increase your fiber work your way up to 50 grams of fiber per day high fiber foods include vegetables nuts seeds and lower sugar fruits like berries if that becomes challenge try fiber supplement such as pgx konjac fiber or glucomannan avoid processed junk foods that includes sodas juices and diet drinks which adversely impact sugar and lipid metabolism research shows liquid sugar calories become the biggest contributor to obesity diabetes and heart disease don be fooled that 100 percent fruit juice is healthy juices are essentially pure liquid sugar because processing strips away the fruit fiber increase omega 3 fatty acids eat anti inflammatory foods like cold water fish including salmon sardines and herring as well as flaxseeds and even seaweed healthy fat actually benefits your heart by improving your overall cholesterol profile it also lowers the small dangerous ldl particles that contribute to heart disease by converting them into light fluffy safe ldl particles discuss how healthy fat can help you achieve and maintain good health in my new book eat fat get thin eliminate all hydrogenated fat hydrogenated fat lurks in margarine shortening processed oils and many baked goods and processed foods like cookies and crackers even when the label states no trans fats the word hydrogenated indicates that the product contains trans fat in one or more of the ingredients use healthy oils instead like coconut oil rich in medium chain triglycerides or mcts extra virgin organic cold pressed olive oil organic sesame oil and other nut oils you can now find mct oil in my store avoid or reduce alcohol intake alcohol can raise triglycerides contribute to fatty liver and create sugar imbalances reducing or eliminating alcohol intake lowers inflammation which contributes to heart disease and nearly every other chronic disease take quality supplements combined with healthy diet and exercise program supplements can dramatically improve cardiovascular health take good multi vitamin mineral along with purified fish oil supplement that contains 1000 to 2000 milligrams day of epa dha you might need higher doses if you have low hdl and high triglycerides also recommend fiber supplement such as pgx konjac fiber or gluccomanan to lower cholesterol and balance blood sugar levels you can find these and other supplements in my store get out and move research shows 30 to 45 minutes of cardiovascular exercise at least five times week can benefit your heart after all your heart is muscle and muscles need exercise if you feel stronger and more capable high intensity interval training also called burst training and strength training help build muscle reduce body fat composition and maintain strong bones you simply cannot age successfully without sufficient optimal exercise manage stress levels stress alone can cause heart attack sadly chronic stress often triggers cascade of events that cause that final fatal heart attack among its problems stress increases inflammation raises your cholesterol and blood sugar increases blood pressure and even makes your blood more likely to clot find your pause button to manage stress and relax yoga tai chi meditation

494,for long time and it actually said from the moment when heard the onkowozie how the system jbl game decided to look into the matter and adopt system to my sw and what should be worse of course there will always be experts on the topic and will hew pegs on the head for solution that made am not an expert on audio but for me such solution is sufficient just with age no longer hear everything there will be some people who will not correspond to my concept and will stand by the only possible solution of course for them namely the removal of the radio signals rca or changing the radio and adding an amplifier do not fully coincide do not want to interfere with radio or system of wires and do not want to give up the display want to be in the middle looked like factory the more that the 206 ka is not car premium but actually for me unless however is if someone does not fit yet can not do this or delegate the task to those skilled in ca but it usually involves the release of thick money or do it your way of course getting the original is possible but easy is not extra price for set of prohibitive started to gain diagrams audio system with jbl and their little analysis needed were the guts bought it on well known site needed were amp eg subwoofer other speakers audio system found have all the parts amplifier can be purchased for approx 30 120z although there are even 200 pln the subwoofer was expensive approx 160 pln subwoofer was so actually needed for the speaker but write about it at later stage after the observation namy leniach thoughts and zastanawianiach bought speakers called midbass hertz ev 165 5 kit esk 165 http www hertzaudiovideo com wp co 165 5_tech pdf bought them together with spacers dedicated to the peugeot 206 at the price of 250 pln tweeters harman kardon with set of factory peugeot acquired with triangles mirrors for 30 pln pcs for those who do not have anything they can buy whole set of ecc 165 approx 450 pln with spacers mdf if someone wants to it can acquire other speakers according to the abundance pocket it not quide elections speakers anyway about speakers can write and write and always will be an opportunity to do something better there had to be better sound for relatively little money experts ca will be upset that installed speakers in the rear doors because scene breaks perhaps they are right but this is the car family and travel together so if sitting in the back wanted to listen to music would have to increase the volume and this would lead me crazy another purchase was soundproofing mats on the door the choice fell on the mat soundproofing tanks alubutyl stp silver and foam rubber damping 6mm k6s this is only the first the inside of soundproofing with the remnants of glue after the original film here paste the image of the front door already taken forgot to take pictures during their wrapping and now have to remove the bacon without soundproofing doors do not expect effects soundproofing is essential for now have done only the front but look forward to some free time money and ll back plus luggage who knows if not yet tempted to center cursory analysis of patterns found that they are all based on the same standard speaker outputs of the radio it does not matter from what if the rb3 rd3 rt3 or rd4 are connected directly to the amplifier jbl on the other hand we work out the sounds of the individual channels and sends them to the speakers already as you can see it can specify blocks that are interested us radio amplifier lp speaker front left lp hf speaker front left tweeter lt speaker rear left lt and pt sub subwoofer left and right channels in one housing pt speaker right behind the pp hf speaker front right tweeter pp right speaker front electrical connections radio rb d3 and the amplifier and speaker connections installation speaker must perform in accordance with the schedule as the radio usually has the power you have to focus on the power amplifier it is provided on pin 1 black plug while the weight on the pin 8 of that plug fuse protection should be the value of 30a did it as much as have done installation bm34 supply shutting windows separate fuse please see description here http www 206club net showthread ph 38 post1600338 should still be interested in pin 7 of the black plug it is connected to the radio to pin corresponding to permit to run the amplifier something la standby or remote otherwise writing turn on the radio turn on the amplifier turn the radio turn off the amplifier we need to connect the 7 pin plug amplifier with pin 5 section radio plug figure below schematic pin plug for rb d3 when buying an amplifier got to set the plug into it what greatly helped me alteration talking with friend from krakow cheers robert hinted at matching connectors from something else but the 206 ki as someone wants can call him and add it here now the question of assembly thought long time to solve the problems associated with placement of everything in the car and after long deliberation decided to mount the amplifier in the glove box checked that it can not be damaged legs and hence the decision in addition was in this location close to the plug in radio leaves the assembly and pulling wires this contributed to the lowest possible interference in the wiring the need to perform beam combining speaker output on the radio input of the amplifier amplifier output plug into speakers by doing it we can come back in minute earlier calls without repeater soon there will be some who find that the original wiring is to sure they are partially right but if the factory radio has an output power of approx 15 18w rms and this amp has 25w rms so see no need to change cables tedious and time consuming how do know that the amplifier is 25w because like real man got under it and read the scalaczk their name tda8563q class amplifier working in the bridge in the notes directory you can read his power to be 25w 4 thd 10 and 14 4v power this power is available for each channel will not elaborate on the power amplifier refer eg here www alldatasheet pl datasheet pdf pdf 19514 philips tda8563q html the amplifier has 4 systems tda8563q so we get 1 scalak front and woofers 2 scalak front and tweeters 3 scalak back and broadband 4 scalak back 1st and 2nd subwoofer amplifier jbl is not such amplifier have in addition to the power amplifiers filters separating the frequency band of the specific type of speaker separated only the front and subwoofer pay attention to the output of the amplifier subwoofer it feeds the subwoofer speaker consisting of two coils in one case speaker speaker double solenoid by the way wonder if it would be proven design with two separate speakers in one enclosure with the structure and patterns that can not be like that connect the speakers as you want you need to connect them exactly as predicted manufacturer you would not get the effect you expect or even uszkodzimy amplifier speaker and yes the pins 7 and 15 and 8 and 16 are intended only for the subwoofer output pins 1 and 2 and 9 and 10 are used only for output front tweeters there is no need to use crossover filter frequency division for specific speakers because they have done so already integrated in the amplifier the rear speakers are tweeters they must be equipped with capacitor odseparowuj cy the bass usually do somewhere in the depths of the internet found the characteristics of the amplifier jbl as you can see the producers already took care of the distribution of frequency and damping unfortunately in my sw missing pillar no place in the plug due to the established folding mirrors so had to tighten the tweeter additional cables using the upgrade connector one steam purchased from your local electronics store for 2 5z pcs those who do not have the option full electrics mirrors will not need it because they will have more space in the plug with the whole fuss with speaker cables is only tightening the wires to the subwoofer and whistles front subwoofer the number of wires 4 two pairs chose to wires 5mm2 mounting leave already own creativity interested because of the banality of execution this connection is done by laying the cables in the original factory mounts along the threshold of the car under the carpeted floor trivial solution and the easiest dismantle need only the lower part of the door seals and plastic in the middle column fastening of seat belts until the end of yet switched on the radio options output settings from the speaker to amp the program pp2000 but here it is the pogadania do not know what miracle but have two radio rd3 01 clarion which behave differently ie one set to have speaker and the second the enhancer and then play both good but the change in their value on the contrary is both play quietly do not know why like it the same receivers do not know whether zatrybicie to this translation of course will not elaborate on the correct installation and caution and accuracy as well as for checking all across the stage adaptive audio system because think the case is clear in this regard now matter subwoofer made chest size under the trunk so that it nicely komponowa a whole measured the capacity of the factory for the subwoofer speaker and it came to me that is 8 liters made your subwoofer design matched to the sw and my thanks to the 25mm mdf board got similar result well maybe little bit bigger well that little boy still learning it helped me to calculate because thanks slants and tilts the side wall and the front it was not as easy as an ordinary simple case and wanted to know exactly how much liter this project the hardest part was cut the wall plate with slants square meter board costs in koszalin approx pln 50 enough was enough in my project and still is the entire casing is made of closed own so mad ni ma design chest leaned on several filmikach which are available on youtube the cut actually milled grooves serve to mask the connections of material such solution also found the net somehow it was called but do not remember how why housing closed because she can forgives many mistakes all the walls are glued and screwed screws chose flat head because after drilling plates larger drill nicely hide and you can not feel the material inside and outside whole lakierowa em clear acrylic lacquer additionally the connection between the walls sealed with clear silicone veneer material blanket glued glue upholstery as you can see was able to choose even the color now question of mounting the subwoofer as you can see in the pictures below chose to mount towards the left do not remember why but had to be reason fixing the subwoofer is little strange but unfortunately to date have not found another important it works well to secure the speaker to be removed and what next well you need to remove one of the mounting studs bacon and through this opening to postpone the screw that has to go through accordingly to the drilled hole in the rear of the subwoofer after twisting the whole body is not going to fly the trunk of course the hole in the wall secured silicone then mount the speaker and grille what got actually that probably not envy the wife of the original jbl anyway stated that the sw game somehow better the effect is probably worse than the ca for 2000z but as said with age but the hearing is deteriorating s such were the stages of the construction of the box guess so ,no

498,in close 7 6 vote committee of medical experts said today that eteplirsen drug to treat duchenne muscular dystrophy has not met the bar set by the fda for approval which could make the drug the third duchenne treatment in recent months to face fda rejection adding to the frustration of tight knit and increasingly desperate community of patients and their advocates the committee one of many that help the fda evaluate drugs for approval wrestled today with question that in most other circumstances would never even merit consideration should the agency approve drug based on one trial with just 12 patients but the consideration was serious because duchenne is progressive fatal disease with no effective treatments or cure throng of patient advocates and others more than 1 000 strong showed up with more than 50 making their case at today hearing in hyattsville md suburb of washington dc that lasted more than 11 hours even the fda top drug official made rare appearance at the meeting weighing in with comments just before the vote still near term approval of eteplirsen developed by cambridge ma based sarepta therapeutics nasdaq srpt appears unlikely the recommendations of fda advisory panels are not binding but the agency typically sides with the experts decisions the 13 member panel voted 7 to 6 that sarepta hasn provided substantial evidence from adequate and well controlled studies that eteplirsen helps duchenne patients bodies create enough dystrophin the muscle protecting protein they lack to predict benefit just before the vote janet woodcock the director of the fda center for drug evaluation and research and key decision maker on drug approvals made clear that the matter at hand was accelerated approval process that allows the agency to green light drugs on thinner body of evidence the fda final decision due by may 26 will have significant implications for both the drug industry and thousands of patients with duchenne approval risks setting precedent for allowing drugs onto the market with bare minimum of human testing rejection means patients whose disease is death sentence lose more time before medicine is available respect the fda caution in setting precedent in approving new drugs but our kids are not precedent they are real live human beings and they are short on time said debra miller the ceo of the nonprofit newport beach ca organization cureduchenne at the hearing an fda official once told me the worst thing we can do is approve drug and then have to pull it off the market argue that the worst thing we can do is deny access to drug and then find out it works too late after we have lost generation of children the implications of this panel were clear from the start william dunn the director of the agency division of neurology products noted that regardless of how urgently drug is needed for duchenne the fda would not lower its approval standards nor would it take perverse delight in rejecting drug he knew what was coming emotions will run high dunn said children with duchenne their parents doctors and even some politicians spoke nearly all pleading for the agency to approve the drug one young patient responding to the agency criticism of eteplirsen effectiveness called the drug amazing and life changing can only guess you don know anything about duchenne he said as applause rang out while the panel voted against eteplirsen woodcock comments seemed to leave the door open for more evaluation in devastating diseases the consequences of this mistake can be extreme she said but most of these cons are borne by the patients that said the agency has already brushed patient and advocate pressure aside in rejecting two other duchenne drugs that were close to approval in january the agency said no to drisapersen drug from biomarin pharmaceutical nasdaq bmrn month later it rejected an approval application from ptc therapeutics nasdaq ptct on drug called ataluren both drisapersen and ataluren are meant to slow the grim march of duchenne in certain subgroups of patients the disease affects about 300 000 people worldwide primarily boys typically robs them of the ability to walk by their teens and eventually kills them through one of number of complications like respiratory or heart failure despite the pressing need for duchenne therapy data from the biomarin and ptc drugs just weren good enough for regulators the agency called biomarin drisapersen data inconsistent and in some cases contradictory and said ptc ataluren application was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review both drugs had failed phase 3 clinical trials but the companies claimed that post hoc analyses showed the drugs were benefitting patients since the february rejection of ptc all eyes have been on sarepta whose eteplirsen is also meant to slow the progression of duchenne in subset of patients group with specific genetic mutation about 13 percent of those with the disease sarepta original january date with the advisory committee was postponed by snowstorm but as with ptc and biomarin sarepta faces next page reprints share underwriters and partners,no

528,heart attack also known as cardiac infarct coronary occlusion coronary thrombosis or acute myocardial infarction is the most serious form of heart disease it is common for persons suddenly affected to drop dead during their normal activities it is essential that you be aware of the symptoms of sudden heart attack today modern treatment is very effective the sooner this is started the greater are the chances of complete recovery the symptoms of heart attack are well established the underlying causes of heart disease have been well documented and the ways of reducing heart attack are clear cut and well established much research has given many answers sensible people will follow the straightforward recommendations offered these are set out at the end of this section it is essential to recognize and provide emergency first aid treatment for possible heart attack heart attack symptoms here are the key heart attack symptoms as set out by the national heart foundation prolonged oppressive pain or unusual discomfort in the centre of the chest behind the breastbone the pain may radiate to the shoulder arm neck or jaw often the pain or discomfort is accompanied by sweating nausea vomiting and shortness of breath may occur sometimes the symptoms subside then recur never forget chest pain that does not go away after 15 20 minutes of rest should never be ignored it could be heart attack what to do in the case of heart attack take immediate action make patient comfortable if conscious sit the person up allay anxiety speak encouraging words call ambulance if possible suggest it may be heart attack and special coronary care ambulance may be available if patient collapses breathing stops or heart stops expired air resuscitation and external cardiac compression must be started if no assistance is available get the patient to the nearest hospital as urgently as possible time may mean life saved the quicker the patient receives expert attention the more likely are the chances of survival and complete recovery they reduce with the passage of time and no help do not be embarrassed about seeking help it is better to be wrong than make an error of judgment keep calm do not panic life could depend on your prompt efficient calm manner the symptoms of an infarction are extremely variable according to the size of the infarct some are major and can produce sudden death but the majority are smaller and produce varying range of symptoms attacks are not necessarily related to exercise as angina is indeed attacks may come on while at rest or even during sleep however usually symptoms and signs are fairly typical and allow doctor to make prompt diagnosis indeed person affected can often form an accurate diagnosis an important rule of thumb is that it is better to inaccurately self diagnose heart attack than miss it early diagnosis and prompt treatment may be lifesaving no age group is immune from cardiac infarcts however they are far more common in males aged 40 70 years males outnumber females by 4 to 1 it seems that increasing numbers of younger males are being afflicted with coronaries this may be related to the added stresses of modern living although others deny this the high level of living with an increase in fat content of food there is greater cholesterol intake and other factors in recent years the importance of smoking as cause of heart disease has become recognized it is now well documented as leading cause of this disability although the heart may have suffered relatively minor muscle damage the chances of severe and usually fatal change in heart rhythm are about 25 times greater during the first four hours than during the next 24 many heart attack patients believe they have indigestion colic dyspepsia or some other trivial stomach upset many feel embarrassed to make fuss or summon assistance fearing they are wrong in their beliefs others deliberately neglect to call help fearing the worst but hoping their inner fears may be wrong each year more than 910000 americans die from heart attacks and diseases of the cardiovascular system e heart and blood vessel systems prompt expert treatment can radically reduce disastrous outcome indeed it is believed that with proper attention 75 per cent of heart attack patients recover and can return to near normal life again heart attack treatment heart attack is medical emergency if person has any of the symptoms enumerated it is imperative to obtain immediate expert medical assistance there is no place for home remedies in these cases apart from allaying the anxiety of the patient and making him or her feel more comfortable taking an aspirin can help while awaiting this attention if sudden collapse occurs and the heart stops beating expired air resuscitation and external cardiac compression will help maintain breathing and circulation if you have had some basic training in this field it is worth commencing and may be lifesaving call an ambulance at once and briefly explain the nature of the symptoms if the ambulance is not available get the patient to the nearest hospital as matter of urgency special mobile intensive care ambulances fitted to meet cardiac emergencies and equipped with highly trained teams called paramedic units are now available in most capital cities in australia and new zealand they can often be at the patient side within few minutes and so can initiate lifesaving treatment within only few moments immediately emergency care has been administered the patient is then transported to the special coronary care ward or intensive care unit of major hospital here highly skilled and very specialized treatment with constant supervision is available the patient is usually attached to constant electrocardiograph machine and screen reveals continuous picture of the heart action the relevant tests that are needed are carried out quickly treatment is maintained at high level of efficiency prompt and accurate diagnosis is made modern tests that seek certain chemicals called enzymes in the blood assist the experts in pinpointing an accurate diagnosis these are called cardiac enzymes their presence can tell the extent of the heart attack subsequent serial tests indicate the progress of the patient death from coronary is usually due to the failure of the heart to continue pumping adequately or to breakdown in the nervous control of the heart which leads to serious condition called ventricular fibrillation newer drugs that assist in bringing this condition back to normal are now being used the drug lignocaine xylocaine assists in reinstating normal heartbeat large family of medications called the beta blockers can also assist in gross heartbeat irregularities machine called defibrillator can also help re establish normal heartbeat activity pain relieving preparations such as morphine oxygen sedation and the medications that have stood the test of time are still widely used for infarcts reassurances and supportive measures are as important today as in earlier days when facilities for emergency treatment were far less sophisticated than they are now act promptly studies have shown that it takes the average heart attack victim three hours to do anything about his symptoms the average time lapse between the onset of warning symptoms and hospital admission is eight hours the first four hours are of paramount importance the earlier heart attack patient can be admitted to hospital and get expert attention the greater are the chances of survival there are many general measures that the anginal patient can carry out and which may effectively assist in keeping symptoms at minimum level avoiding the known precipitating factors will help immeasurably the patient should make an effort to avoid undue exercise that is known to produce symptoms similarly social and environmental predisposing factors must be avoided it is best to avoid circumstances where emotional crises and flaring tempers are involved for this will only breed more and greater problems if allowed to persist it would be best if the patient could adopt philosophical attitude to life in general accept the position and make the most of the remaining years of life meals of moderate size and easily digestible food preferably low fat in content and free from fried foods are best if there is obvious overweight sticking to 4200 kj 1000 calorie day diet for while will help lower the weight and so diminish the risk factors regular sleep often assists eight hours night is preferable sometimes with carp onset of the symptoms period of bed rest may be advisable gearing life to meet one ability at coping is essential the same applies to work with due retard to the social and economic

553,history the patient is 4 month old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with peak gradient of 29 mmhg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16 bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta procedure after sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia the patient was prepped and draped cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets vascular entry was by percutaneous technique and the patient was heparinized monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg continuous pulse oximetry and cycled cuff blood pressures in addition to intravascular pressures using percutaneous technique 4 french 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place there was good blood return from both the ports using 4 french sheath 4 french wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries the atrial septum was not probe patent using 4 french sheath 4 french marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ascending aorta and left ventricle descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery the transverse arch measured 5 mm isthmus measured 4 7 mm and coarctation measured 2 9 1 8 mm at the descending aorta level the diaphragm measured 5 6 mm the pigtail catheter was exchanged for wedge catheter which was then directed into the right innominate artery this catheter was exchanged over wire for tyshak mini 6 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist pressure pull back following angioplasty however demonstrated residual of 15 20 mmhg gradient repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing the angioplasty was then performed using tyshak mini 7 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist the pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for pressure pull back measurement and final angiogram flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta after angiography two normal appearing renal collecting systems were visualized the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis the patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition there were no complications discussion oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia there is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt further the heart was desaturated due to vq mismatch phasic right sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the wave similar to the normal left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 12 mmhg left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with 60 mmhg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 29 mmhg systolic gradient on pressure pull back to the descending aorta the calculated flows were mildly increased vascular resistances were normal cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels there is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmhg to 92 mmhg there remained 4 mmhg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmhg systolic gradient pressure pull back to the descending aorta the calculated systemic flow fell to normal values final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and small left lateral filling defect consistent with small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus there is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries the narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4 9 4 2 mm diagnoses 1 juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta 2 dilated cardiomyopathy 3 bicuspid aortic valve 4 patent foramen ovale intervention balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta management the case will be discussed at combined cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery case conference the patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery the patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4 6 months the further cardiologic care will be directed by dr ,yes

568,study results show bypass surgery extends lives of patients with heart failure national institutes of health nih institute center national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi contact nhlbi engagement and media relations branch link sends mail 301 496 5449 study results show bypass surgery extends lives of patients with heart failure research may lead to improved outcomes for large number of patients who previously had limited therapeutic options scientists funded by the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi of the national institutes of health have found that greater number of patients with coronary artery disease may benefit from coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery than previously thought cabg surgical procedure to help improve blood flow to the heart by bypassing arteries clogged with cholesterol plaques was thought to be too risky for patients with the long term effects of coronary artery disease left ventricular dysfunction when the left side of the heart is unable to pump normally and heart failure studies of the safety and effectiveness of cabg in the 1970s excluded most patients with these two conditions the procedure was typically used to relieve angina or chest pain with limited data showing any benefit for patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure physicians and patients were less likely to engage in such an invasive and thus risky procedure as cabg for diagnosis and treatment said lead author eric velazquez md facp facc fase faha of duke university medical center patients with these conditions largely received medical therapy alone and had poor outcomes dr velazquez and his team conducted five year global randomized controlled clinical trial called the surgical treatment for ischemic heart failure stich study and five year extension study stiches link is external to evaluate whether cabg plus guideline directed medical therapy had durable benefit over medical therapy alone for patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction the researchers found that cabg added to medical therapy led to significantly lower rates of death and hospitalization among patients with coronary artery disease left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure our results usher in new era in the treatment of coronary artery disease because we now have evidence that with cabg and medical therapy there is 16 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause over 10 years dr velazquez said he added that there is also median survival benefit of nearly year and half and that he and his team saw that the addition of cabg to medical therapy prevented death from any cause for every 14 patients they treated their data further suggest that the reduction in the risk of death could be even greater in real world practice conducting this trial was critically important to determine in scientifically rigorous study that cabg improves survival for individuals with coronary artery disease and compromised left ventricular function said nhlbi director gary gibbons md the current 10 year follow up provides new important insights about patient subgroups that are more likely to benefit from cabg as compared to medical therapy alone as such we now have solid evidence base to inform patient care and the future development of clinical practice recommendations dr velazquez noted that the results are particularly important because the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure is expected to increase to approximately 8 million individuals by 2030 in the s alone the increase in the projected prevalence is result of advances in the management of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors increasingly transforming coronary artery disease into chronic disease with long term effects such as left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure george sopko md mph the program director in nhlbi division of cardiovascular sciences who administered the study grant added that this investigation published in the new england journal of medicine april 2016 is one of only few cardiovascular trials with 10 years of follow up and with approximately 98 percent of the patients followed throughout the study period it is unusual to have this quality of follow up for so long said dr sopko it speaks to the rigor of the results he added that the results are very

using modified seldinger technique and long 6 french ao sheath was introduced secondary to tortuous aorta next judkins left catheter was used to engage the left coronary system cineangiography was recorded in multiple views next judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary system cineangiography was recorded in multiple views next the judkins right catheter was used to engage the svg to om cineangiography was recorded next the judkins right was advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over long exchange length wire for 4 french left internal mammary artery which was used to engage the lima graft to lad and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views next an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity lv pressures were measured lv gram was done and pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded next an aortogram was done and recorded at this point decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex therefore ava 3 5 guide was used to engage the left coronary artery angiomax bolus and drip was started universal wire was advanced past the lesion and 2 5 balloon was advanced first to the proximal lesions and predilations were done at 14 atmospheres and then to the distal lesion and predilatation was done at 12 atmospheres next we attempted to advance 3 0 12 stent to the distal lesion however we were unable to pass the stent next second dilatations were done again with the 2 5 balloon at 18 atmospheres however we are unable to break the lesion we next attempted cutting balloon again we are unable to cross the lesion therefore buddy wire technique was used with pt choice support wire again we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent we then try to cross with noncompliant balloon which we were unsuccessful we also try to cutting balloon again we were unsuccessful despite multiple dilatations we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion therefore finally the procedure was aborted final images showed no evidence of dissection perforation or further complication the right groin was filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results the patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications was taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor diagnostic findings 1 the lv lvedp was 4 lves is approximately 50 55 with inferobasal hypokinesis no significant mr no gradient across the aortic valve 2 aortogram the ascending aorta shows no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection the valve shows no significant aortic insufficiencies the abdominal aorta and distal aorta shows significant tortuosities 3 the left main the left main coronary artery is large caliber vessel bifurcating the lad and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10 20 4 left circumflex the left circumflex vessel is large caliber vessel gives off distal branching obtuse marginal branch the upper pole of the om shows retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately 70 80 stenosis the mid left circumflex is high grade 80 diffuse tortuous stenosis 5 lad the lad is totally 100 occluded vessel the lima to lad is patent with only small to moderate caliber lad there is large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the lad and that proximal lad showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60 70 the diagonal shows proximal 80 stenosis 6 the right coronary artery the right coronary artery is 100 occluded there are retrograde collaterals from left to right to the distal pda and plv branches the svg to om is 100 occluded at its take off the svg to pda is not found however presumed 100 occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right 7 lima to lad is widely patent assessment and plan attempted intervention to the left circumflex system only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty unable to pass stents noncompliant balloons or cutting balloon final images showed some improvement however continued residual stenosis at this point the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored we can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management the patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal however due to the length of this procedure did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch possible consideration would be stress test as an outpatient depending on where patient shows ischemia focus on treatment to that lesion ,yes

superficial femoral artery using self expanding nitinol supera stents in patient with acute thromboembolic limb ischemia department of cardiology vascular medicine grn hospital weinheim 69469 weinheim germany received 29 november 2015 accepted 11 april 2016 academic editor hiroyuki nakajima copyright 2016 tom eisele et al this is an open access article distributed under the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited abstract the treatment of acute thromboembolic limb ischemia includes well established surgical thrombectomy procedures and in recent times also percutaneous rotational thrombectomy using straub rotarex system this modality not only enables efficient treatment of such thrombotic occlusion but also in rare cases may imply the risk of perforation of the occluded artery herein we report the case of perforation of the superficial femoral artery sfa in an elderly female patient with thromboembolic limb ischemia the perforation was successfully treated by implantation of self expanding nitinol supera stents and without the need for implantation of stent graft 1 introduction peripheral artery disease pad exhibits increasing morbidity and mortality during the last few decades 1 and is estimated to affect over 200 million people worldwide including up to 30 of elderly primary care individuals 2 3 patients with symptomatic pad exhibit life expectancy of 80 within 5 years of follow up 4 5 whereas patients with critical limb ischemia cli show significant poorer outcomes with amputation and death rates of 15 20 and 25 respectively within the first year after diagnosis 6 especially patients with acute thromboembolic limb ischemia are in high risk of major amputation and death due to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction such patients are usually older than 75 years and show further comorbidities including atrial fibrillation and history of heart failure 7 the treatment of this limb and life threatening condition includes well established surgical thrombectomy procedures and in recent times also percutaneous rotational thrombectomy procedures using straub rotarex system if required in combination with local thrombolysis 8 this method enables quick and efficient treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolic occlusion despite the low complication rate of rotational thrombectomy perforations of the occluded artery have been reported previously herein we report the case of perforation of the superficial femoral artery sfa in an elderly female patient with thromboembolic limb ischemia which was successfully treated by implantation of self expanding nitinol supera stents 2 case presentation an 85 year old female patient was referred to our department with new onset of severe pain paleness and pulselessness of her left leg since 12 hours duplex sonography revealed thrombotic occlusion of the left common femoral artery cfa figure 1 and the patient was immediately scheduled for digital subtraction angiography dsa the patient had history of arterial hypertension and heart failure but no history of clinically evident pad dsa confirmed the thrombotic occlusion of the cfa figure 2 and interventional treatment was initiated after injection of 500 mg aspirin and 5 000 u of heparin after insertion of an 0 018 guide wire rotarex catheter ab medica gmbh sseldorf germany thrombectomy was performed in the cfa and in the proximal superficial femoral artery sfa figure 2 resulting in antegrade flow in both sfa but with high remaining thrombotic burden in the cfa figures 2 and 2 after repeated rotarex catheter thrombectomy perforation of the sfa was noticed which persisted despite prolonged inflation using mm balloon figures 2 2 due to persistent perforation the implantation of 2 overlapping mm nitinol supera stents abbott vascular illinois usa was performed which resulted in complete repair of the vascular injury of the sfa figures 2 and 2 local lysis was subsequently performed due to high remaining thrombotic burden of the cfa using 10 mg bolus injection of actilyse recombinant tissue plasminogen activator boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh ingelheim am rhein germany and continuous infusion of 1 mg for further 16 hours repeated dsa was scheduled for the next day in the mean time pain symptoms of the patient improved whereas she recovered from paleness of the lower limb except for the area of her distal foot the next day dsa revealed complete resolution of the thrombus in the cfa figure 3 however reocclusion of the sfa was unfortunately noticed figure 3 orange arrow requiring repeated rotarex catheter thrombectomy and implantation of 2 further self expanding nitinol innova stents mm and mm

3 3 after the second angiographic procedure pain symptoms and limb paleness and paresthesia were completely resolved in addition holter monitoring revealed the presence of atrial fibrillation and the patient was put on treatment with aspirin 100 mg daily clopidogrel 75 mg daily and 5 mg subcutaneous fxa inhibitor fondaparinux for 4 weeks ambulatory duplex sonography at 4 weeks of follow up demonstrated good triphasic flow pattern in the sfa figure 4 and the patient was put on treatment with coumadin figure 1 thrombotic occlusion of the left common femoral artery cfa absence of flow can be appreciated in the distal part of the vessel associated with thrombus formation red arrows the origin of collateral artery can be depicted proximally to the vessel occlusion yellow arrow figure 2 occlusion of the cfa is noticed by dsa rotarex catheter thrombectomy reestablishes antegrade flow in the cfa and sfa but thrombotic burden remains high as it can be appreciated by the orange arrows in mid and distal parts of the sfa with thrombus formations can also be appreciated in after repeated rotarex thrombectomy perforation of the sfa is noticed with persistent despite prolonged balloon inflation orange arrows in g subsequently 2 overlapping nitinol supera stents are implanted resulting in complete cessation of the bleeding complication orange arrow in figure 3 during the second angiographic session dsa reveals not only complete resolution of the thrombus in the cfa but also reocclusion of the sfa orange arrow in requiring repeated rotarex thrombectomy and implantation of further self expanding nitinol stents subsequently good angiographic flow can be achieved in the sfa and in the popliteal artery with 1 vessel run off of the anterior tibial artery f figure 4 triphasic flow in the sfa at 4 weeks of follow up 3 discussion to the best of our knowledge this is the first case reporting the placement of self expanding nitinol supera stent for the management of perforation in peripheral artery in the past decades significant technical developments have occurred with endovascular therapy of acute thromboembolism which offer several advantages over open surgical embolectomy techniques for the treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolic occlusion 8 although the straub rotarex system is widely available and well established for the treatment of such thrombotic lesions perforations of the occluded artery have been described previously and in our case in such cases usually stent grafts are employed however such stent grafts are expensive and are usually deliverable using 8f sheaths this may require an additional arterial puncture under full anticoagulation or lead to additional time spent for changing the arterial sheath which may aggravate bleeding complications in our case the sfa perforation could be successfully treated using self expanding nitinol supera stents which are deliverable using 6f sheath 4 conclusion herein we report the placement of self expanding nitinol supera stent for the management of perforation in peripheral superficial femoral artery further novel options of complication management as described in our case may shift the treatment from surgical to even more endovascular treatment procedures in the future competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests references

indications persistent chest pain on maximum medical therapy with known history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in year 2000 procedure after the risks benefits and alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail an informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion 1 lidocaine solution was then used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery once adequate anesthesia had been obtained thin walled 18 gauge argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance small nick was then made in the skin and its pressure was held the needle was removed over the guidewire 6 french sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance the guidewire and dilator were then removed the sheath was then flushed next angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire the catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle the guidewire was then removed the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed lvedp was then measured and found to be favorable for left ventriculogram the left ventriculogram was performed in the rao position with single power injection of non ionic contrast material lvedp was then remeasured pullback was then performed which failed to reveal an lvao gradient the catheter was then removed next judkins left 4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of guidewire the guidewire was removed the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed using hand injections of non ionic contrast material the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views once adequate study has been performed the catheter was removed next judkins right 4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of guidewire the guidewire was removed the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed the ostium of the saphenous vein graft was engaged using hand injections of non ionic contrast material the saphenous vein graft was visualized in several different views the judkins right catheter was then advanced and the native coronary artery was engaged using hand injections of non ionic contrast material right coronary system was evaluated in several different views once adequate study has been performed the catheter was retracted we were unable to engage the left subclavian artery thus the catheter was removed over an exchange wire next multipurpose catheter was advanced over the exchange wire the wire was then easily passed into the left subclavian artery the multipurpose catheter was then removed lima catheter was then exchanged over the wire into the left subclavian artery the guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed lima graft was then engaged using hand injections of non ionic contrast material the lima graft was evaluated in several different views once adequate study has been performed the lima catheter was retracted under fluoroscopic guidance the sheath was flushed for the final time the patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and

592,a a rock bottom hello world m jay bee this is the me against me project blog get ready for run on sentences should you look around you ll notice that this isn the first blog entry for my project but it will be my final attempt last do over if you will to overcome my many issue while chronicling my journey in an effort to showcase the seriousness of these issue the reality of what binge eating disorder looks like that it real the physical repercussions of having e the confusion of trying to figure out the best way to get healthy the overpowering stress of it all and the sometimes lack of available help to treat and defeat my particular forms of mental physical illness see warned you about run on sentences get ready for more am completely worn out mentally physically spiritually from my dealings with mental illness for what feels like forever ve tried so many times to get healthy and having ultimately failed every single time another failure will most like result in well let not think of that right now considering how young am it crazy to think of just how sick weak and old feel some of the stuff am dealing with physically doesn usually occur in people until they are much older and have lived long life of beating themselves up with poor diet drinking and smoking with my mental health issues and the resulting physical problems that stem from never overcoming those issues exist within an incredibly dangerous combination of crap perfect for an early death the great list of issue binge eating disorder e panic disorder kinda like having anxiety problems but this version is constant and relentless in it pursuit to rob you of any sort of peace and happiness you become distant sort of robot chronic depression when you re happy you re normal when you re sad you re very sad morbidly obese weighing as much as 400 lbs massive list of physical issues due to so many years of battling food addiction extreme weight changes the constant stress from everything mentioned above type 2 diabetes the only time m happy to settle for not being number one sleep apnea slightly enlarged heart due to the sleep apnea morbid obesity and diabetes high blood pressure constantly dizzy light headed highly inflammatory body in the danger zone for heart attack stroke extreme acid reflux weakened and inflamed throat esophagus sinus airways lungs from choking on acid in my sleep super fun way to wake up in the middle of the night skin disorder developed from poor diet high sugar in blood psoriasis like vision issues high blood pressure and diabetes are making my vision fade quickly bone joint issues hips popping out randomly tightness everywhere straight neck compressed lower back it all causes lots of numbness inability to move without pain or just not being able to move at all back muscle issues lower back gets strained pulled constantly can move can walk constantly winded feeling sick m always out of breath and feel dizzy or sick just talking makes me winded sometimes flushed face feels hot face always looks oddly red and flushed in comparison to the rest of my body around my eyes and my face always feels hot and somewhat numb to the touch persistent liver gallbladder pains something is going on in my liver gallbladder pancreas area the area is painful most of the time now and have symptoms of some scary stuff going on honestly there are probably more issue than that but whatever you get the idea at this point the deck is definitely stacked against me the odds of full recovery are not in my favor m sure if you re of more rational and sane mind you re probably thinking how the hell did you let yourself get that sick that fat that unhealthy well that what makes all of this so tricky it the necessary part of e food addiction which mental health professionals still won officially say exists that makes them bonafide mental illnesses you can overcome them alone and or you have to reach your own version of rock bottom to truly be able to get better even if you have moments where you can kinda see it like that guy in the predator movie there something in those trees you can try to get healthy lose weight work out but ultimately you fail you usually gain even more weight than before along with new accompanying physical problems that make sedentary lifestyle feel most comfortable and your e food addiction gains much greater hold over you you fall into an even deeper and darker hole and you feel almost powerless to try and overcome yourself your disease have tried so many times to figure out this puzzle up until almost two years ago there was virtually no help for someone with binge eating disorder it was just recently officially recognized as mental illness important side note doctors can be really dumb so beware if you were going to get any help at all you had to be assigned an illness you didn actually have they diagnosed me as bulimic even though told them never vomit or you had to pay out of pocket for an extremely expensive treatment facility but the chances of that fancy facility accepting males was virtually zero so if you were guy with e you were basically screwed now things are little different since e was officially claimed as mental illness there are couple commercials about e one of which is specifically trying to sell you some poisoned pills ll get into that another time there a nice website called neda that offers some assistance to those looking to find help for e though there was no place near me when last checked and health insurance has to accept your claim of being mentally ill now thus provide you with assistance getting help as for me am at place where ve finally accepting that can not in any way overcome my illness without serious help from mental health professionals ve actually always known that but until recently never had way to get the help that so desperately needed where mean m finally accepting that am helpless is in the following ve been trying to get myself clean by getting on healthy cleanse diet and overcoming the intense physical withdrawals feel when stop eating sugary and bad carb foods for me food addiction is no joke get very sick for nearly week with some wicked physically mental withdrawals for the last four months each time ve attempted this diet have failed have allowed that failure to hold myself back from admitting myself into an eating disorder clinic this is where am giving in see that the self sabotage part of my mind has been holding me back with this need to get clean before entering treatment it been kind of convenient excuse for the repetitive binge inducing diet failure ve been repeating for the last few months now no more prepping for my admittance to treatment tomorrow will be in contact with an eating disorder clinic to set up my admittance asap so there it is now we re all basically on the same page you know exactly what all m dealing with over the next however long it takes to get healthy ll be posting daily blogs regular vlogs on my youtube channel and random thought updates etc on facebook twitter ll include the links to everything on this page so feel free to follow along like subscribe and all that good stuff if you or anyone you know is struggling with binge eating disorder be sure to go to neda to find some helpful info and free hotline to call as for following along with my project maybe you ll discover something that helps you find your own way toward getting healthy or at least you ll realize that e and food addiction are both very real and very dangerous m definitely not doing any of this for popularity it actually quite humiliating to share all of this hope to be an example for the millions of people that knowingly or unknowingly struggle with what have to show how hard it is to exist with e food addiction mental illness and morbid obesity hopefully my experiences and brutal honesty along the way about what m dealing with and going through will help others most importantly this project will show everyone that this isn a problem that you can fix on your own you ll need help to truly recovery from such mental and physical issue it going to take multiple health professionals and the assistance of others that are caring and understand you re illness it takes community for me realize that ll have to piece together that community for myself but at least still have hope and that good enough for now feel free to contact me with any questions comments or concerns together we shall overcome love jay bee facebook page please like share

594,sarepta issues statement on advisory committee outcome for use of eteplirsen in the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy cambridge mass business wire sarepta therapeutics inc srpt developer of innovative rna based therapeutics today announced that the s food and drug administration fda peripheral and central nervous system advisory committee pcnsc met to review the new drug application nda for eteplirsen as treatment for duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 51 skipping the advisory committee voted 6 7 against the finding of substantial evidence from adequate and well controlled studies that show that eteplirsen induces production of dystrophin to level that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit fda question 2 the advisory committee voted 3 7 with three abstentions against finding substantial evidence based on the clinical results of the single historically controlled study study 201 202 that eteplirsen is effective for treatment of dmd fda question 7 we would like to thank the hundreds of patients and families who participated in the discussion today underscoring the critical unmet need of people living with duchenne said edward kaye d sarepta interim chief executive officer and chief medical officer we appreciated the opportunity to present our data to the advisory committee panel and will continue to work with fda as they complete their review of the eteplirsen nda today more than ever we remain committed to our mission of bringing treatment to the duchenne community dmd is rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder causing severe progressive muscle loss and premature death the fda is not bound by the advisory committee recommendation but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing new drug and biologic license applications in general the prescription drug user fee act pdufa action date for completion of fda review of eteplirsen is may 26 2016 in three additional voting questions the panel voted 5 to 7 with one abstention against whether decisions to administer the 6 minute walk test vs conclusions that the patient could no longer walk were sufficiently objective and free of bias and subjective decision making by patients their caregivers and or health care professionals to allow for valid comparison between patients in study201 202 and an external control group fda question 4 the panel voted on the impact of the north star ambulatory assessment with one panel member voting that it strengthened the persuasiveness of the findings in study 201 202 with five voting that it weakened the persuasiveness and seven voting that it had no effect fda question 5 the panel also voted on the impact of the other tests of physical performance g rise time 10 meter run walk on the persuasiveness of the findings in study 201 202 with the result of one panel member voting that they strengthened the persuasiveness two voting that they weakened the persuasiveness and ten voting that they had no effect fda question 6 the pcnsc advisory committee recommendation was based on review of results from the phase iib clinical program for eteplirsen studies 201 and 202 long term outcomes through 168 weeks from the study 202 open label extension study as well as 4 year clinical effectiveness data based on comparison of patients in study 201 202 to historical control group that was designated as major amendment to the nda in january 2016 about the 6 minute walk test 6mwt the 6mwt was developed as an integrated assessment of cardiac respiratory circulatory and muscular capacity for use in clinical trials of various cardiac and pulmonary conditions in recent years the 6mwt has been adapted to evaluate functional capacity in neuromuscular diseases and has served as the basis for regulatory approval of number of drugs for rare diseases with mean changes in the 6mwt ranging from 28 to 44 meters additionally published data from longitudinal natural history studies assessing dystrophinopathy disease continuum comprised of dmd and becker muscular dystrophy support the utility of the 6mwt as clinically meaningful endpoint in dmd these data show that boys with dmd experience significant decline in walking ability compared to healthy boys over one year suggesting that slowing the loss of walking ability is major treatment goal about duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is an linked rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder causing severe progressive muscle loss and premature death one of the most common fatal genetic disorders dmd affects approximately one in every 3 500 5 000 males worldwide devastating and incurable muscle wasting disease dmd is associated with specific errors in the gene that codes for dystrophin protein that plays key structural role in muscle fiber function progressive muscle weakness in the lower limbs spreads to the arms neck and other areas eventually increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure the condition is universally fatal and death usually occurs before the age of 30 about eteplirsen eteplirsen is designed to address the underlying cause of dmd by restoring the messenger rna mrna reading frame thus enabling the production of shorter functional form of the dystrophin protein eteplirsen uses sarepta proprietary phosphorodiamidate morpholine oligomer pmo chemistry and exon skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene approximately 13 percent of the dmd population is amenable to exon 51 skipping data from clinical studies of eteplirsen in dmd patients have demonstrated consistent safety and tolerability profile and have also shown measurable dystrophin protein expression promoting the synthesis of shorter dystrophin protein is intended to slow the decline of ambulation and mobility seen in dmd patients there currently is no approved treatment in the united states for dmd and eteplirsen has not been approved by the fda or any regulatory authority for the treatment of dmd about sarepta therapeutics sarepta therapeutics is biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique

602,preoperative diagnosis coronary artery disease postoperative diagnosis coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis description of procedure left heart catheterization with angiography and mid abdominal aortography under local anesthesia with 2 lidocaine with premedication right groin preparation was done using the percutaneous seldinger technique via the right femoral artery left heart catheterization was performed coronary arteriography was performed with 6 french performed coronary catheters we used 6 french jr4 and jl4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries after using the jr4 6 french catheter nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm and following that we used 5 french jr4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta analysis of pressure data left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 5 mmhg on continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta there is no gradient across the aortic valve the aortic pressures were normal contours of intracardiac pressure were normal analysis of angiograms selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle coronary arteries and mid abdominal aorta pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position the mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility the left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility aneurysmal dilatation and or dyskinesia absent the aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility the ascending aorta appeared normal pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries an abdominal aortic injection was performed under fluoroscopy we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation there was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be tight stenosis the abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity there is normal left renal artery normal right renal artery the celiac seems to be normal but what believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal the common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area coronary anatomy one notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery cineangiogram obtained with 6 french jr4 and 5 french jr4 catheters prior to the introduction of the 5 french jr4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually the 6 french jr4 catheters appeared to show an ostial lesion of over 50 there was backwash of dye into the aorta although there is fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn there is 50 smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third then the artery seems to have little bit more normal size and it divides into large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery we then removed the 6 french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed 5 french catheter and again finding stenosis may be less than 50 at the ostium of the right coronary artery calcification again is identified backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion looked about the same 50 along the proximal turn of the shepherd turn area the left coronary artery is normal although there is rim of ostial calcification but there is no tapering or stenosis it forms the left anterior descending artery the ramus branch and the circumflex artery the left anterior descending artery is very large vessel very tortuous in its proximal segment very tortuous in its mid and distal segment there appears to be some mild stenosis of 10 in the proximal segment it gives off large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease the remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease upon injection of the left coronary artery we see what believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus and we get ventriculogram performed could not identify an isolated area but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place the ramus branch is normal and free of disease the left circumflex artery is tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease the patient has predominantly right coronary system there is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems the patient tolerated the procedure well the catheter was removed hemostasis was achieved the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition impression 1 excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size 2 calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels the left and right renal arteries are normal the external iliac arteries are normal 3 essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula 4 ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50 or greater the proximal right coronary artery has 50 stenosis as well 5 coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries recommendations the patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed the ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe it is at least 50 but it could be worse therefore she will be evaluated for the possibility of an ivus and or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery we will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well continue aggressive medical therapy ,yes

604,source by dr mercola have you checked your vitamin status lately ideally you want to maintain vitamin level of 40 to 60 ng ml year round based on mounting research 40 ng ml appears to be the magic number at which whole host of health benefits are reaped vitamin deficiency has been linked to variety of illnesses 1 including heart disease stroke hypertension autoimmune diseases type 1 and type 2 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis crohn disease multiple sclerosis cognitive decline alzheimer disease infectious diseases and several deadly cancers this includes cancers of the breast colon prostate ovaries esophagus lymphatic system and even melanoma vitamin lowers overall mortality risk it no surprise then that the institute of medicine iom reports an association between vitamin and overall mortality risk 2 in one 54 month long study3 involving more than 422 800 healthy adults those who were most deficient in vitamin had an 88 percent increased risk of death from any cause this is the kind of benefit m talking about when say it would be wise to temper fears of melanoma the deadliest form of skin cancer and weigh that risk against other benefits such as significantly reduced risk of death from any disease moreover by adhering to sensible sun exposure guidelines and making sure you do not get burned you can maximize your benefits and minimize the risks of skin damage that could lead to skin cancer on the whole overexposure not avoiding all sun exposure is the real problem when it comes to raising your risk for skin cancer 4 please read this important ftc article in highly controversial action last week the ftc had me stop selling our uv light systems which they classified as tanning beds but was providing as far more effective option for vitamin to the hundreds of millions of people who don have access to enough sunshine the legal battles with the ftc lasted few years and required me to travel to washington dc to meet with the ftc attorneys to work through these issues finally chose the lesser of all the evil options that were available to me if you have not yet read my detailed rebuttal to the ftc action against me please do so now and let me know what you think about this important health freedom threat really am interested in hearing what your thoughts are on this important issue your input on this means lot to me thanks for taking the time to respond higher vitamin lower cancer risk previous research found that vitamin level of 50 ng ml was associated with 50 percent lower risk of breast cancer 5 breast cancer patients with an average vitamin level of 30 ng ml were also twice as likely to survive compared to women with low levels average 17 ng ml 6 most recently researchers at university of california san diego school of medicine report that raising your serum 25 hydroxyvitamin 25 oh to 40ng ml can slash your risk of all invasive cancers by 67 percent 7 8 9 according to study co author cedric garland dr h 10 we have quantitated the ability of adequate amounts of vitamin to prevent all types of invasive cancer combined which had been terra incognita until publication of this paper these findings support an inverse association between 25 oh and risk of cancer and highlight the importance for cancer prevention of achieving vitamin blood serum concentration above 20 ng ml the concentration recommended by the iom for bone health improving vitamin status is key cancer prevention tool by pooling data from two previous studies one randomized trial and one cohort study the former of which showed 77 percent lower cancer risk for women with vitamin level of 40 ng ml compared to baseline of 28 ng ml11 they were able to get much larger sample size with broader range of vitamin levels this allowed them to more accurately determine the ideal vitamin level for cancer prevention the study included all invasive cancers with the exception of skin cancer and had follow up period of nearly four years as reported by science daily 12 in the lappe trial cohort the median blood serum level of 25 oh was 30 nanograms per milliliter in the grassrootshealth prospective cohort it was higher 48 ng ml the researchers found that the age adjusted cancer incidence was 1 020 cases per 100 000 person years in the lappe cohort and 722 per 100 000 person years in the grassrootshealth cohort cancer incidence declined with increased 25 oh women with 25 oh concentrations of 40 ng ml or greater had 67 percent lower risk of cancer than women with levels of 20 ng ml or less primary prevention of cancer rather than expanding early detection or improving treatment will be essential to reversing the current upward trend of cancer incidence worldwide the researchers wrote this analysis suggests that improving vitamin status is key prevention tool research needs to be translated into public health policy in creighton university press release co author robert heaney d highlighted the importance of sensible sun exposure for vitamin optimization and the need to modify public health policy with regards to sun exposure as noted in the press release 13 be sure you re getting as much vitamin as nature would give you under natural circumstances and you were wandering around outdoors exposing lot of skin in the summer heaney said he refers to study in which vitamin levels were analyzed for native tribes in east africa they received nearly 10 000 international units per day of vitamin and had lower cancer risk in 2010 the institute of medicine recommended vitamin dosage of 600 international units per day that not enough says heaney but what is enough for heaney he believes people should first discover how much vitamin is in their blood levels this is your blood level right now you know how much you re taking if you want it higher increase your dose so then everybody is in control of their own vitamin nutritional status that way instead of having to be dependent on lab tests and physicians heaney said drawing on results from his study heaney believes vitamin needs to be widely discussed we have got to find way to translate these studies into public health policy heaney said at the end of january 2016 president obama established the cancer moonshot task force with the aim of creating comprehensive plan to enable progress in treatment and care of cancer 14 optimizing vitamin is one of the foundational recommendations that really need to be part of that plan yet it not at least not yet how does vitamin help protect against cancer vitamin influences virtually every cell in your body and is absolutely crucial to radically reduce your risk of cancer your organs can convert the vitamin in your bloodstream into calcitriol which is the hormonal or activated version of vitamin your organs then use it to repair damage including that from cancer cells vitamin also triggers apoptosis cell death in cancer cells according to dr garland in nearly all forms of breast cancer vitamin affects the structure of your epithelial cells these cells are held together by glue like substance called cadherin which provides structure to the cell cadherin is made up of mostly vitamin and calcium if you don have adequate vitamin that structure comes apart and those cells do what they are programmed to do in order to survive they go forth and multiply if this cell proliferation gets out of control you may end up with cancer if you have breast cancer in progress the addition of vitamin can help stop cancer cells in their tracks by replenishing cadherin once cancer growth is slowed your immune system can begin to get ahead of the cancer cells because it doesn have to deal with such an overabundance of them it just disposing of the leftovers low vitamin predicts aggressive prostate cancer in related news researchers at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine recently discovered that men diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer have vitamin levels below 23 ng ml according to this study vitamin may actually be used as biomarker to predict the aggressiveness of prostate cancer as noted in university press release 15 the relationship between vitamin and prostate cancer may explain some disparities seen in prostate cancer especially among african american men prior research showed african american men who live in low sunlight locations are up to 1 times more likely to have vitamin deficiency than caucasian men but because vitamin is biomarker for bone health and aggressiveness of other diseases all men should check their levels lead investigator dr adam murphy said all men should be replenishing their vitamin to normal levels murphy said it smart preventive health care vitamin dramatically improves heart function yet another recent study found that vitamin has nothing short of amazing ability to improve heart function in those with chronic heart failure the five year long trial included 160 patients undergoing conventional treatment for chronic heart failure half of them were given vitamin d3 supplement the other half received placebo in addition to their standard of care after one year the vitamin group experienced significant improvement in heart function compared to the placebo group as reported by the independent 16 dr klaus witte who led the research project told the independent the improvements seen in patients taking the vitamin were nothing short of amazing and called his team findings significant breakthrough researchers made ultrasound scans of participants hearts and measured the how much blood was being pumped with each heartbeat to get figure called ejection fraction the ejection fraction of healthy person is usually around 60 to 70 per cent but it dropped to an average of 26 per cent among the patients enrolled in the study for those who took vitamin d3 the ejection fraction was improved from 26 to 34 per cent while the rest experienced not change for some patients this discovery means regularly taking vitamin d3 could lessen the need for them to be fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd which can correct dangerous heart rhythms the researchers note that even though they used vitamin d3 supplement in this study exposure to sunlight would likely produce the same results for the simple reason that it all about achieving higher vitamin serum level comparing our modern lifestyle to that of ancient humans who spent far more time outdoors the researchers link our current deficiency epidemic to chronic sun avoidance current advice to avoid sun exposure seriously endangers your health indeed dermatologists have severely compromised the public health by fighting an irrational and dangerous war against uv exposure be it from the sun or uv light devices disease statistics reveal the sun scare campaign has really been taken too far at present the s surgeon general 17 18 the american academy of dermatology aad and many other cancer organizations recommend complete and total sun avoidance in order to prevent skin cancer the aad will not even acknowledge different recommendations based on skin type even though it widely recognized that darker skinned individuals need far more uv exposure in order to produce vitamin in their skin adding insult to injury the s preventative task force suggests vitamin testing is unnecessary and both the institute of medicine iom and the american medical association ama recommend vitamin serum levels and vitamin intake levels that are far below ideal based on the evidence in the medical literature the iom recommends taking just 600 ius of vitamin a day up to age 70 but as pointed out in 2014 paper 19 the iom underestimates the need by factor of 10 due to mathematical error this error has never been addressed moreover research20 suggests it would require 9 600 iu of vitamin per day to get majority 97 5 percent of the population to reach 40ng ml meanwhile the ama uses of 20ng ml as sufficient but as shown in the featured study this level significantly increases your risk for cancer 40 ng ml is really the cutoff point for sufficiency in order to prevent wide range of diseases sun avoidance equals smoking in terms of mortality risk sun avoidance actually increases your risk of death very similar to that of smoking that was the conclusion of recent competing risk analysis by swedish researchers who found that while women with active sun exposure habits had higher risk of melanoma compared to sun avoiders they also had lower risk of mortality from far more deadly diseases than melanoma including cardiovascular disease according to the authors 21 nonsmokers who avoided sun exposure had life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun exposure group indicating that avoidance of sun exposure is risk factor for death of similar magnitude as smoking compared to the highest sun exposure group life expectancy of avoiders of sun exposure was reduced by 0 6 2 1 years when you look at the overall picture it clear to see that we are building the perfect storm for serious negative health outcomes due to vitamin deficiency the role of vitamin in disease prevention growing body of evidence shows that vitamin plays crucial role in disease prevention and maintaining optimal health there are about 30 000 genes in your body and vitamin affects nearly 3 000 of them as well as vitamin receptors located throughout your body according to one large scale study optimal vitamin levels can slash your risk of cancer by as much as 60 percent keeping your levels optimized can help prevent at least 16 different types of cancer including pancreatic lung ovarian prostate and skin cancers how vitamin performance testing can help optimize your health is it any wonder then that no matter what disease or condition is investigated vitamin appears to play crucial role this is why am so excited about the action project by grassrootshealth dr robert heaney is the research director of grassrootshealth and is part of the design of the action project as well as analysis of the research findings grassrootshealth shows how you can take action today on known science with consensus of experts without waiting

of heart disease in the united states every year that one in every four deaths the impact of cardiovascular diseases is quite large the university of alabama at birmingham is home to many talented investigators who study various aspects of heart disease within the school of medicine division of cardiovascular disease at the comprehensive cardiovascular center and across uab primary goal of both the division and ccvc is to actively promote innovative interdisciplinary and translational cardiovascular research many distinct yet often complementary basic and clinical studies are ongoing at uab with alabama ranking among states with the most heart related deaths this innovative research is providing benefits to patients now and in the future uab researchers are focusing on five key areas with an ultimate goal of improving the care of cvd patients heart failure heart failure is chronic progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to function adequately and distribute sufficient oxygen and nutrients to meet the body needs in other words the heart cannot maintain its workload multiple researchers at uab are investigating the mechanisms by which heart failure occurs as well as searching for ways to prevent heart failure and devise improved treatment strategies heart failure can arise as consequence of ischemic events such as heart attack indeed heart attack survivors are at increased risk for heart failure development ongoing research is trying to uncover the nature of this relationship during ischemic events the immune system becomes activated which is essential for the repair of the heart however inappropriate activation of immune cells results in chronic inflammation which worsens damage to the heart thereby contributing to heart failure development director of the uab cardiovascular disease division and the ccvc sumanth prabhu d is currently focusing on the role of specific immune cell populations in producing heart damage and on finding way to manipulate immune systems so they do not become hyperactivated similarly research in the laboratory of ganesh halade ph is studying novel lipid species known as resolvins which are able to reverse inflammation in the heart roger white ph and his collaborator m anantharamaiah ph are exploring the anti inflammatory properties of high density lipoprotein mimetic compounds in atherosclerosis and other disease states other important areas of heart failure research involve energetics regeneration cellular survival and remodeling studies in the laboratory of min xie d are currently defining whether activation of self preservation mechanisms such as autophagy promote survival of heart cells thereby attenuating contractile dysfunction following heart attack in terms of remodeling louis dell italia d is studying the mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling during heart failure which can lead to stiffening of the heart both xie and dell italia have identified novel therapeutic targets that improve cardiac function in pre clinical models heart failure research further extends to the clinic with multiple active clinical studies assessing the intramyocardial delivery of mesenchymal stem cells as novel therapeutic in patients with heart failure genomic determinants of patient response to pharmacological therapy immune cell activation in chronic disease heart failure outcomes research using the intermacs registry and testing of novel circulatory support devices and other therapeutics in patients with advanced heart failure the studies are led by multiple investigators including prabhu salpy pamboukian d jose tallaj d britta brott renzo loyaga rendon d and deepak acharya d clinical researchers including massoud leesar d seun alli d and brott are examining interventional approaches to ischemic and valvular heart disease and associated cardiomyopathy these include novel strategies for coronary intervention and stent design outcomes after percutaneous structural valvular interventions and developing paradigms for adjunctive anti platelet therapy after interventional procedures nita limdi ph is leading an institutional precision medicine effort to uncover the clinical impact of genomic variation in the metabolism of anti platelet drugs after coronary intervention hypertension research hypertension or high blood pressure typically has no symptoms but can have deadly health consequences if not treated according to the american heart association nearly 80 million s adults have been diagnosed with high blood pressure suzanne oparil d professor of medicine and past president of the american heart association is part of groundbreaking study called the sprint trial that suggests changing blood pressure guidelines could cause the falling death rate from heart attacks and stroke to drop even more the trial found that pressure below 120 was preferable for high risk patients number of hypertension patients are unresponsive to conventional treatment strategies these individuals known as resistant hypertensive patients require three or more anti hypertension treatments to help manage their blood pressure david calhoun d professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular disease is pioneer in translational studies designed to identify underlying mechanisms causing resistant hypertension as well as in the management of this disease paul muntner vice chair of the uab department of epidemiology in the school of public health recently received prestigious grant from the american heart association to study 24 hour patterns in blood pressure blood pressure usually decreases during sleep an event termed dipping however in some individuals blood pressure does not decrease during the night this non dipping event is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease the study by muntner and colleagues calhoun orlando gutierrez d edward inscho ph oparil david pollock ph jennifer pollock ph and martin young ph is investigating the incidence of non dipping in distinct racial groups as well as the potential mechanisms leading to this condition related stories,no

620,procedure performed 1 left heart catheterization with coronary angiography vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography 2 right femoral selective angiogram 3 closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an angio seal indications for procedure the patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004 she has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort and has ongoing risks including current smoking diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia to name few the decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression description of procedure after informed consent was obtained the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed she was prepped and prepared on the table after which her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1 lidocaine then 6 french sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over standard 0 035 guide wire coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using 6 french jl4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery 6 french jr4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit subsequently 6 french angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform power injection left ventriculogram at 8 ml per second for total of 30 ml at the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque did have normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation as such an initial attempt to advance perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery as such the perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system we then replaced this with 6 french angio seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis the patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the mac unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home hemodynamic data opening aortic pressure 125 60 left ventricular pressure 108 4 with an end diastolic pressure of 16 there was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle left ventricular ejection fraction was 55 mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1 there was normal wall motion in the rao projection coronary angiogram the left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque the proximal lad was 100 occluded the left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque the obtuse marginal branch which operates as an om 2 had mid approximately 80 stenosis at kink in the artery this appears to be the area of prior anastomosis the saphenous vein graft to the om this is very small caliber vessel and is 1 5 mm in diameter at best the right coronary artery is dominant the native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque the distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40 stenosis the posterior left ventricular branch has proximal 50 to 60 stenosis the proximal pda has 40 to 50 stenosis the saphenous vein graft to the right pda is widely patent there was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the pda the runoff from the pda is nice with the native proximal pda and plv disease as noted above there is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent the lad beyond the distal anastomosis is relatively small caliber vessel there is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into more proximal diagonal branch the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004 overall this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004 conclusion 100 proximal lad mild left circumflex disease with an om that is small caliber vessel with an 80 lesion at kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention the native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate plv and pda disease the saphenous vein graft to the om is known to be 100 occluded the saphenous vein graft to the pda and the saphenous vein graft to the lad are open normal left ventricular systolic function plan the plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control the patient goal ldl will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150 and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking after her bedrest is complete she will be dispositioned to home after which she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month we will also plan to perform carotid duplex doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits ,yes

636,by scott morgan mount kilimanjaro 5 895 meters above sea level is one of the tallest in the world the mountain which is found in northern tanzania has continued to be popular tourist destination over the years the mountain is major challenge to conquer and requires adequate mental and physical preparation to increase the chances of succeeding you need to start training for kilimanjaro early at least two months before the hike the type of physical routine that you get involved in should help you build cardiovascular endurance and your muscle strength weight training helps you improve your performance and helps protect joints such as the ankles knees and the spine which tend to be strained when hiking your target should be to carry backpack of about 20 pounds as you take flight of stairs at rate of 30 steps minute the amount of training that is required greatly depends on your initial fitness level persons that have not hiked before will on average require longer duration of physical exercise than those that hike regularly beginners are advised to start by walking outdoors for short distances such as mile and increasing the gradually to say four or five miles take stairs as often as possible it is important that you keep consulting with your doctor to ensure that you remain medically fit the doctor will subject you to full checkup to find out if you have any diseases that would make it difficult for you to go for the hike some of the conditions that may be cause for concern include metabolic disorders such as diabetes chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure and hypotension apart from being physically fit you need to also prepare your body physiologically at high altitude the air is thinner and oxygen supply is markedly reduced high altitude training helps your body to pre acclimatize so that you can cope with such strenuous conditions the best way of achieving this is to be involved in several shorter hiking exercises regularly this can be easily done within tanzania where there are number of smaller mountains near kilimanjaro to be used for practice whether you are beginner or an experienced climber you need to arrive few days earlier this will help you relax and shake off the jet lag at the same time it will give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the local climate and food there is at least 5 chance of making it to the peak if you arrive in good time you need to carry with you number of essential items the technical clothing will typically include hiking pants long sleeved shirt waterproof jacket with hood pair of gloves and sports bra for women important equipment specific to the exercise include map compass or gps sleeping bags and headlamps among others other accessories include towel toilet paper soap and so on persons that are traveling to tanzania need to ensure that they have the proper documentation that will allow them enter the country visa requirements apply to most countries outside the commonwealth ensure that you find out in advance what is required for your specific case it would be unfortunate to miss out on the opportunity after weeks of preparations about the author if you are looking for the facts about training for kilimanjaro go to our web pages online here today further details are available at http www isoldeulrich com now ,no

642,about 30 years ago completed my internal medicine training in upstate new york which included weekly outpatient clinic and ward rotations at the local va hospital love military history and enjoyed the opportunity to talk to many ww ii veterans back then there were even few ww soldiers still around in those days these were everyday working class even humble men who quietly lived common lives but had participated in some of the most storied and celebrated battles in the last century they were part of generation that made tremendous sacrifices and embodied many of the values that made america great it was my privilege to hear some of the stories of this so called greatest generation first hand one ww ii veteran was in my clinic for over two years so was his physician for an extended period time he was tall large man with long grey beard and he always wore confederate cap always thought the hat reflected bit of his gentlemanliness demeanor with just hint of rebel in him he was simple man who although was so much younger basically kid in those days always treated me with the utmost respect and called me doc but never with my last name we got to know each other fairly well as he was in severe chronic heart failure so was seeing him in my clinic on frequent basis to adjust his medications one day he told me his own personal story about the war it turned out he had served under patton in north africa he described the scene of his last battle in that war and in my minds eye felt was there he was on high hill and the germans had overrun and nearly surrounded his position most of his company had been killed or retreated from his position he could see the enemy advancing on three sides it was rock and gravel and sand like the moon there was dust and the smell gunpowder and the smoke and odor of burning diesel and oil the germans could not see his exact location and so were firing indiscriminately up the hill on the other hand from his vantage point he could see the terrain well and was systematically picking off enemy soldiers one at time with well placed rifle shots he was apparently incredibly deliberate and collected under the most intense circumstances his own foxhole buddy was already down but he thought still alive it was only matter of time before they were both either dead or prisoners suddenly the enemy stopped firing and my friend knew that the germans were sending scout to ascertain his precisef location to better target his position he also knew that he only had few moments left so he picked up his buddy in fireman carry and started running away from the enemy positions had he not been carrying his friend he would have been able to move much faster he was nearly over the crest of the hill that would have put him temporarily out of sight and gun range when he was knocked down bullet tore through his left shoulder and upper chest he fell heavily to the ground with gaping chest wound his friend rolled short distance completely inert it was only much later he would find out his buddy did not survive my friend was bleeding heavily but his next breath collapsed his lung and much of the bleeding must have slowed he lost consciousness and awoke in the dark he was unable to get up and drifted in and out of consciousness all night the next day he was picked up by american forces that had reclaimed that territory of the battlefield his wounds were severe and his recovery prolonged but he survived though he never fought in uniform again he was awarded the purple heart but other more prestigious metals of distinction would never come because no one else lived to testify about his heroism he had not told the story to many people he said because he just never enjoyed talking about the war lifetime of cigarettes and alcohol had taken toll on him as he fought other inner battles not the kind of fights that were won by guns or violence when met him as mentioned he was also battling severe health problems remarkably was able to keep him out of the hospital for fairly long time however eventually things fell apart and he was hospitalized and started down hill spiral he had been in for few weeks and just not getting better during that time he had no visitors and he never spoke of family so suspected he was alone in the world was on call every third night which typically meant working 36 hours straight it was after midnight and visited him in the icu the room was dark and we could only see from the dim lights in the hallway he knew that he only had short time left he thanked me for the care had given him and then started talking about the war again you know doc never regretted the things did or those germans killed knew if didn kill them they would kill me but lately in my dreams m seeing the faces of all those young german boys killed thought to myself their faces pondered if this was trick of his memory but didn ask how close quartered his combat experience had been generally you see an enemy face in hand to hand combat had always presumed the enemy was far away and never really knew exactly how many there had been now in his final battle he was going back to one of his first battles death is the final enemy and my friend knew he was going to the same place to which he had sent others to years ago he died that night alone with his memories and dreams he was soldier patriot hero and had become my friend many of us don really understand the physical and mental burdens our veterans carry with them often for their entire lives it was my honor to know and serve this true hero thank you friend for your service and sacrifice and also thanks to all the countless others who have served in uniform fought killed and even died for our safety and freedom ,no

said it could be fatal and suddenly their eyes looked at me different as called my family to tell them they needed to come looked at picture of my four daughters before long as they whisked me away to the hospital prayed please god let me be back to raise them at that time while was terror stricken the doctors implanted metal filter in my main vein leading to my lungs to prevent any clots from breaking off and traveling there to kill me remember being awake as they threaded tiny metal basket down through my neck through my heart down into my abdomen safety net they told me until formed another clot above it and that clot became fear in the form of my own body the months after that were beyond harrowing was scared to be alone in case collapsed and the kids were left alone was scared to drive for fear that they clot would travel and kill me and d cause an accident in the process was literally scared to move had talks with the girls about how much loved them they needed to always know talks with justin about if he was faced with raising them alone please be gentle please surround them with loving women please remind them of me fitting everything you want to say in is even harder than it sounds constant appointments several ambulance rides blood tests genetics testing all to later find that the reason d gotten the clot in the first place was because of cluster of events including genetic condition called factor leiden my body once triggered to clot would have difficult time shutting off that process chain effect but even though that was the most terrible time in my life through god grace recovered slowly and timidly nervous to put my toes back in the water the girls grew was grateful to be there to watch it and never took it for granted time marched on but never far from the what ifs of if it ever happened again the fear has stifled imprisoned taunted it has whispered to me in dark rooms and been my alarm clock many mornings had just started getting counseling for what my therapist thought was ptsd from it when suddenly month ago completely out of the blue and four years almost to the day felt that familiar pain again and the panic returned surely it was just anxiety surely just needed to breathe deeper calm my thoughts surely but unable to let it go called the doctor and almost collapsed when after an ultrasound they told me had clot once again the room spun rung my hands can barely remember leaving that place how could this be my path again god didn i suffer enough and the waves were up to my waist fear had returned with his ugly face to whisper see told you so you ll never be able to get away own you but as fear tried once again to take over god voice reminded me that what satan lays out for evil god re weaves for good now ve had weeks of tests blood work and appointments back to the same seat in the clinic waiting room that still somehow feels warm from when left the doctor in order to verify there was no further clotting up higher ordered ct scan he said just to be sure went and shook and tears dripped into my ears as lay there on my back being prepped prayed in that tube staring up at the light painted to look like beautiful sky as if painted cherry blossom and cloud was going to calm me was done soon enough and went home and then waited and waited and waited week went by with no word surely that was good news right surely they would have contacted me by now if something was there they weren expecting by this friday was praying prayer of thanks as pulled into my mom group at church thankful for the grace of each new day thankful for what was obviously good but then got the message the ct scan results had not showed any further clotting but incidentally had seen fluid around my heart note said needed to call my cardiologist right away the message said try not to worry it should have also said definitely do not google but of course did and the findings were so scary that the water around me looked like mud there are many reasons one could develop fluid around their heart and many different levels you could have small effusion caused by virus or illness you could have medium sized one caused from trauma or autoimmune issue or in the worst scenario you could have large effusion that could be life threatening and often had very high mortality rate caused from cancer or bleeding from the heart surely mine was small then told myself felt ok they would have called me to come in right away if it were more serious right spent my weekend in on off fear crying often laughing some thinking constantly the waves slowly moving up further and now around my neck this morning before could even call her the phone rang it was my cardiologist her voice sounded serious as she laid out the next steps to diagnose the whys of this new finding d need an echocardiogram and some blood work to start once they figured out the reason and actual amount of fluid they would know how to treat it she said she had seen the report but would need to know more before she could know how to move forward and then asked it even though didn want to asked what size are we talking ve been looking online and she said the thing didn even think could be well it looks like it large and now was underneath the undertow was so strong heels pitched above my head she said words after that barely heard other than to go to the er if wanted to expedite things and not wait any more days to begin being treated so went barely able to move my eyes side to side knew from my reading that sometimes the large effusions are caused by warfarin which m on for the clot that often in that case the fluid they are seeing is blood that it makes it very complicated to even know how to treat because the blood thinners make the fluid dangerous to drain because you could bleed out but to go off of my blood thinners at this point could cause wide spread clotting from the factor which could also kill me from the minute got to the hospital it was clear my doctor had called ahead was taken in quickly and by half an hour later had had an ekg an iv started 11 tubes of blood taken blood pressure cuff placed history gone over and chest ray done the nurse entered and said that what they were concerned about was an enzyme indicating impending heart failure that would most likely be admitted soon the doctor came in and repeated what the nurse had said with the addition of indicating d most likely be undergoing trans esophageal echo which would require sedation and was an in patient procedure though walk through the valley of the shadow of death asked to please use the bathroom and when closed myself in stood and begged god begged for miracle and then heard it be anxious for nothing but in all things with prayer and thanksgiving make your requests known to god was forgetting the thanksgiving because isn that just what satan loves to draw our eyes and hearts away from the good that we ve been granted to pull us into something that stifles to call from the dark bushes hey look over here with thanksgiving thankful that they at least caught this thankful for quick moving diagnosis thankful knew that no matter what was about to come he held all of my days in his hands and nothing could separate me from them went back to the room where my mom waited looking concerned asked her if she pray specifically for complete healing specifically said for the issue to disappear those were the words and then something happened five minutes later the doctor appeared with something in his hands do you want the good news or the bad news he said not the bad replied covered in tape and tubes and monitors really don want the bad news at all well that good he said because there isn really any held my breath what was he about to say he said he didn really know how but there appeared to have been typo that it looked like the report had eluded to large pericardial effusion but that for some reason there was no mention of it in the conclusion portion of the report he was seeing he said it should have been highlighted as the number one thing but it wasn even mentioned he thought this was strange when reading it so he had asked to have the scans sent to him and he had called in the hospital radiologist to help him review them he said that after looking at the scans carefully they both agreed that not only was the effusion not large but there was no evidence of any fluid around my heart and my heart was perfectly healthy could hear the second hand tick silence could this even be furthermore he said there was also no evidence of additional clotting and my filter was still in place was free to go home gasp above the surface cried in that moment like crazy person sobbing laughing laugh sobbing and that went on for over an hour as the doctor and nurses and techs came in to say they just couldn believe it and congratulations heard him calling my doctors with the news and suddenly was laying on the shore clothes wet face down but alive and grateful that sometimes when the tide is pushing in it bringing you back in with it because he asks us to trust and keep our eyes fixed and he will quiet the storm because never fails actually means never god did miracle for me today in my physical heart and in the heart at my core the one from where my real life stems two doctors had seen that report and been alarmed enough to have me admitted but suddenly there was nothing there the beautiful sky was looking up at was the real one because he perfects all that which concerns us because the promise is that though we walk through the fire we will not be burned lift my eyes up to the mountains where does my help come from it comes from the maker of heaven and earth the maker of hearts and blood and bodies from the maker of futures the maker of plan for me and the one who sets my feet over and over on solid ground don know what is planned for me because of the strength ve gained through these things don know the people ll meet who might need to hear that ve been there too and made it out alive and they will too don know what lies over the dunes and out into the world beyond this ocean of trial what do know is that my faith was strengthened today after seeing that have faced fear and possible death multiple times and each time have been spared and ever moved up to the dry parts of the shore ,yes

681,warning signs can vary wildly between men and women both men and women can experience chest pain when they are having heart attack but other symptoms can significantly vary according to the university of alabama dr joseph fritz if you think of someone having heart attack chances are you will picture scene where man gasps clutches his chest and falls to the ground but in reality heart attack victim could easily be woman and the scene not be so dramatic while men and women share some of the same symptoms the university of alabama dr joseph fritz explains they can also have wildly different ones both men and women can suffer chest tightness and pain or pressure in the chest neck jaw arms or back unusual fatigue shortness of breath coughing feeling sick and vomiting are among the unpleasant symptoms experienced by both genders other major symptoms for men include weakness breaking out into cold sweat dizziness major symptoms for women include sleep disturbance indigestion anxiety however dr fritz also urged people to remember each heart attack is different and symptoms may not always exactly fit the mould never ignore any possible symptoms of heart attack and get medical attention immediately women heart attack symptoms can include indigestion and sleep disturbance which can be mistaken for signs of something else women are likely than men to die within year of their first attack women are more likely than men to die within year of their first heart attack according to the american heart association that is because while both genders experience chest pain as the primary symptom women often have atypical vague symptoms as well such as back or jaw pain nausea or sense of dread earlier this year dr laxmi mehta of ohio state university said these symptoms can be very challenging for the patient and the medical profession women tend to under recognise or deny them when they do present to the emergency department it is important for these symptoms to be triaged appropriately as potential heart problems otherwise the consequences are misdiagnosis delayed treatment and higher death rates even things considered more minor health problems such as sexual health bleeding gums and even snoring could be sign of poor heart health when the heart and arteries begin to fail symptoms manifest in otherwise unrelated parts in the body revealed dr john erwin cardiologist from texas m health science center dr erwin revealed six of the most common and most surprising symptoms of heart disease that people need to be aware of keeping an eye out for these problems can lead to earlier detection of the disease and help save lives symptom 1 sexual dysfunction many people think of sexual dysfunction as problem of the reproductive organs or the brain however especially in males sexual dysfunction is common symptom of arterial disease erectile dysfunction is typically thought to be problem of the brain or reproductive system however it can also occur because of buildup of plaque in the arteries which can lead to cardiovascular disease buildup of plaque in the arteries can cause men to have hard time achieving or maintaining erection but for women drop in libido usually signals post menopausal state yet women who are post menopausal rapidly increase their risk factors for developing heart disease menopause itself doesn cause cardiovascular disease dr erwin said while menopause doesn cause cardiovascular diseases certain heart health risks like changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels begin around the time of menopause furthermore many women develop more sedentary lifestyle in that phase of their lives as result this symptom should not be ignored symptom 2 snoring or sleep apnea few things are more frustrating in life than trying to sleep next to snoring person however on top of the annoyance of snoring dr erwin revealed it can actually be sign of heart disease snoring is common sign of sleep apnea as is morning sleepiness after full night sleep dr erwin said sleep apnea periods of time during sleep where you stop breathing is associated with many physiological changes that increase the risk of both heart attack and stroke snoring may be annoying but it is symptom of sleep apnea which can often signify heart disease snoring can also be sign of atrial fibrillation which is an irregular often rapid heart rate that causes poor blood flow therefore detection and treatment of sleep apnea can lower person risk of heart problems so next time you hear the person next to you snoring perhaps suggest they see doctor instead of just complaining about the noise symptom 3 bleeding sore or swollen gums few people would ever think that gum problems could be linked to heart disease however unhealthy gums are symptom of periodontis that is serious gum infection that damages the gums and can destroy the jawbone periodontis can actually lead to an increase in inflammation across the body according to dr erwein and over activity of inflammatory pathways is strong risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic heart disease and heart attack thus it recommended that people follow up regularly with their dentist for oral hygiene they should also regularly brush and floss their teeth symptom 4 shoulder or neck constriction or aching many people feel like an elephant is sitting on their chest during heart attack and many others experience squeezing sensation in their arms however not all people go through those classic heart attack feelings constriction or aching in the shoulder or neck or swollen and bleeding gums may appear to be minor health problems but in reality they can be symptoms of heart disease and should be checked out by doctor instead many heart attack sufferers feel an uncomfortable sensation achiness pain or pressure in their neck jaw or shoulders for some that discomfort is the only sign of heart pain or heart attack symptom 5 puffy feet and legs feet and legs can swell for variety of reasons including something as minor as heat however puffy legs and feet can also be marker of congestive heart failure that particularly true in cases where person has unusual shortness of breath with activity or when trying to sleep while it also true that some swelling occurs naturally throughout the day and tends to resolve overnight persistent swelling is problematic people who have constant or worsening swelling of the feet or legs should see doctor for an evaluation of heart failure symptom 6 indigestion or heartburn heartburn and indigestion are quite common and rarely serious but in some instances those seemingly benign burning or aching sensations in the upper abdomen can be sign of heart pain or heart attack additionally persistent gastrointestinal distress such as intractable hiccups can also be precursor and so when heartburn indigestion or hiccups are mixed with nausea sweating shortness of breath or lightheadedness people should seek medical attention dr erwin said it not uncommon to see people come into the emergency room after chewing on antacids for hours before they realize the pain is

687,the technology has given rise to lot of modern inventions in the world and few from the invention has contributed the medical science field the new robotic surgery introduced by computer science scientist had helped doctor in order to complete his surgery fast and easy to implement the robotic surgery doctor just need to send the robot inside the human body by building probe later your physician can monitor the robotic action through computer and offer instruction into it easily after the operation continues to be completed successfully the robot is taken off in the body and consequently the surgery can get completed within 10 to 15 minutes of your time even though the pure forskolin reviews ideas are blooming in the medicinal field still traditional and natural medicines are been employed by doctors since they are seen to cure diseases easily and helps to steer an issue free life the very best natural medicine which employed to cure respiratory diseases and heart failures is forskolin belly buster the medicine was extracted from the roots of coleus plant and it was manufactured as pills powders and eye drops it is recognized to reduce multiple diseases in people like obesity menses pain skin diseases allergy bowel syndrome devmqky69 problems urinary infections reducing cancer cells in body blood pressure level chest pain asthma insomnia seizure accidental thrombus and lot of other difficulties the medicine is proved to be safe one in humans but people who have low hypertension pregnancy mother newest born babies and those that are likely to take surgeries should be very careful within their consumption those individuals should consult with your physician priorly and also have pure forskolin only when it really has been prescribed from the doctor thus by proper medical advice we can avoid many medical negative effects in us the forskolin is known to lessen the blood pressure levels level within the body however when it was actually taken with some other high blood pressure medicines then our pressure level reaches the minimum and result in many problems in the event the coleus interacts with medicines that increases blood flow then it will lead to dizziness headache and giddiness some of the medicines which are used for blood circulation are nitro bid sorbittrate and etc thus avoid such medicines while consuming coleus or maybe it may lead to many dangerous adverse reactions so avoid such pills while taking coleus people should always consult with the doctor for best medicinal advice and also for choosing best medicines self prescription is not going to work all time and will also also result in many adverse reactions so always go in accordance with the doctor advice ,no

708,by butch meriwether you might ask yourself what this virtual who who of diseases such as al amyloidosis chronic cell leukemias chloracne diabetes mellitus type 2 hodgkin disease ischemic heart disease multiple myeloma non hodgkin lymphoma parkinson disease peripheral neuropathy porphyria cutanea tarda prostate cancer respiratory cancers and soft tissue sarcomas have in common the answer is simple they are the many illnesses the s government has admitted are associated with the exposure to agent orange hopefully with time our government will admit there are other diseases caused by their spraying of herbicides and defoliants than they originally admitted to some may ask what agent orange is and believe it or not more and younger people have never heard of that term even though it has caused illnesses or deaths of thousands of people what is interesting is was at doctor office not too long ago and medical assistant ask me what agent orange was when mentioned that it had caused most of my medical issues the term agent orange is derived from the combination of code names for herbicide orange ho and agent lnx agent orange was one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the s military as part of its chemical warfare program operation ranch hand during the vietnam conflict from 1961 through 1971 and besides that the 55 gallon drums the deadly toxins were shipped in had big orange strip around it thus where the name agent orange came from during the vietnam war the united states military sprayed millions of gallons of deadly material containing chemical herbicides and defoliants in vietnam eastern laos and parts of cambodia according to the worldwide web the program goal was to defoliate forested and rural land depriving guerrillas of cover and to induce forced draft urbanization destroying the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside and forcing them to flee to the s dominated cities thus depriving the guerrillas of their rural support and food supply many are unaware the s government also sprayed agent orange in korea many of the people exposed to agent orange and ll call them poor souls didn find out the true justification for their debilitating illnesses until later in life and some never found out what caused their illnesses before they died another interesting fact is some vietnam veterans who have had or now have diseases brought on by exposure to agent orange dioxin is not alone and many of their children are also infected by agent orange these children through birth are the second generation of people suffering from agent orange exposure and many wonder if there will there be third or fourth generation the s government has continued an attempt to downplay the effects of exposure to agent orange the red cross of vietnam estimates that up to one million vietnamese people are disabled or have health problems due to agent orange but the s government has dismissed these figures as unreliable and unrealistically high many americans are currently suffering or have died from the consequences of agent orange exposure without ever receiving medical care of monetary compensation conservative is estimates are that more than 2 4 million americans in addition to allied forces and the vietnamese people were exposed to the deadly brew of pesticides and defoliants guess m one of the more lucky ones who now receive medical care and monetary compensation from my illnesses due to my exposure to agent orange for information purposes served in vietnam during 1967 68 69 and 70 just think left vietnam in 1970 but the government didn admit my illnesses were not associated to agent orange until about 42 years later the money is great but the debilitating effects suffer from my exposure to agent orange continues and each day look healthier than really am have learned more about some of past illnesses and some from ones that are now surfacing here is my who who of illnesses have either suffered or currently now suffer heart attack and quadruple bypass operation yep was cracked open like walnut in 2003 congestive heart failure ischemic heart disease type ii diabetes high blood pressure skin cancer neuropathy and they implanted pacemaker in me last year am also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease better known as copd but the s government hasn yet admitted it is caused by my exposure to agent orange according to the department of veterans affairs an agent orange settlement fund was created by the resolution of the agent orange product liability litigation class action lawsuit brought by vietnam veterans and their families regarding injuries allegedly incurred as result of the exposure by vietnam veterans to chemical herbicides used during the vietnam conflict remember they never designated it as war the suit was brought against the major manufacturers of these herbicides the class action case was settled out of court in 1984 for 180 million dollars reportedly the largest settlement of its kind at that time the settlement fund was distributed to class members in accordance with distribution plan established by united states district court judge jack weinstein who presided over the litigation and the settlement because the plaintiff class was so large an estimated 10 million people the fund was distributed to class members in the united states through two separate programs designed to provide maximum benefits to vietnam veterans and their families most in need of assistance payment program that provided cash compensation to totally disabled veterans and survivors of deceased veterans and class assistance program that provided funds for social services organizations and networks for the purpose of establishing and maintaining programs for the benefit of the class as whole applications for the payment program had to be submitted prior to december 31 1994 and program operated over period of 6 years distributing total of 197 million in cash payments to members of the class action in the united states of the 105 000 claims received by the payment program approximately 52 000 vietnam veterans or their survivors received cash payments which averaged about 3 800 each not much for their suffering and or death on september 27 1997 the district court ordered the fund closed its assets having been fully distributed another sad thing to come about was the supreme court put the preverbal skids on thousands of americans who faithfully served their county during the vietnam war and korea and who were exposed to the agent orange by making ruling in 2009 the supreme court let stand lower court rulings that the companies were not responsible for the implications of military use of agent orange because the war materials were supplied at the direction of the s government that decision basically made it impossible for individuals exposed to agent orange to be able to sue dow chemical and monsanto south korea highest court upheld ruling during july 2013 ordering two s agent orange makers to compensate 39 vietnam war veterans in one of the country most prominent lawsuits the supreme court recognized the epidemiological correlation between the toxic defoliant agent orange and skin diseases for the first time saying the 39 victims should receive total of 466 million won hk 3 21 million from dow chemical and monsanto it isn too late for those s military veterans and their families to receive medical care and financial aid the veterans administration continues to attempt to help those military personnel and their families suffering from various illnesses brought on by their exposure to deadly toxin but they can only do so much spouses and dependent children of living veterans also may be eligible for health care and other va benefits and surviving spouses dependent children and dependent parents of veterans who were exposed to agent orange or other herbicides during military service and died as the result of diseases related to the exposure may be eligible for survivors benefits if military veteran dependent of veteran or parent of veteran believes their illnesses was caused by exposure to agent orange they should contact their nearest veteran service officer fraternal veteran service organization or department of veterans affairs in order to learn more about applying for disability through the va ,yes

716,every time we pray the lord prayer most of us say forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us this however is not what matthew 6 12 actually says there we read forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors in matthew 6 14 15 jesus explains that if we forgive the trespasses of others ours will be forgiven but if we do not forgive the trespasses of others then ours will not be forgiven in luke the word used is sins as jesus probably did not speak in greek all of the new testament is translation of the aramaic which he would have spoken and in jewish thought of his time debts trespasses and sins were interchangeable concepts their meaning would overlap think that english does provide us some interesting depth though today mp gospel is from section on forgiveness in mt 18 15 35 it begins with how to confront those who have sinned and then goes on to say that when two or three gather in jesus name he is with them for many christians this is very uncomfortable word from the lord because he says that the church humans are an extension of god in other words there is no simple division between god and man as is so popular among many jesus says in other places as well that when we are in him our words and actions carry the divine imprimatur and convey the power and authority of god jesus takes the church very very seriously our reading today begins in verse 21 where peter asks how many times must we forgive seven times this is biblical number and conveys the idea of generous mercy however jesus ups the ante considerably the greek can be translated as seventy times seven 490 or seventy seven 77 there is probably reference here to genesis 4 24 if cain is avenged seven fold truly lamech seventy seven fold and makes clear that we as jesus people are in the mercy and forgiveness business the lord then illustrates the principle with parable man is in debt owing ten thousand talents one talent is about six to ten thousand denarii denarii is day wage so it is at least six thousand days wages or about seventeen years wages multiply that by ten thousand and you have many many lifetimes of debt it is totally unpayable the equivalent of billion dollars for us so the man is to be sold into slavery and his family as well however after begging for mercy and making the ridiculous promise to pay it back if given time the man receives gracious kindness and the master writes off the debt then the same man bumps into someone who owes him one hundred days wages just over three months however he ignores the pleas for mercy and imprisons his debtor in the end other servants distressed by his cruelty go to the master and inform him of this turn of events so the master confronts the man and points out the mercy which he received the lack of mercy he demonstrated and the punishment he receives what he gave the other prison in english the words sin and trespasses are negative they refer to an act which transgresses debt on the other hand has broader meaning debt is something owed sin focused western christians can be so sin aware that we are at risk to overlook the blessings for which we are also indebted to god we also have an unpayable debt of gratitude too often people view their minor sins as unworthy of death sentence even if god is perfect it does not resonate that he cannot bear to be in the presence of flawed humanity perhaps if that is how you think it is easier to imagine god problem with people who are so far in debt for blessings as well as sins not being grateful and graceful to others let ponder every breath is gift hundreds of gifts each hour day after day if you don believe it ask someone with copd or asthma or lung disease every breath gift debt each heart beat is gift sending life sustaining blood throughout our bodies hundreds of heart beats day day after day if you don believe ask someone unable to walk because of congestive heart failure or other heart disease every beat of your heart gift debt is seeing blessing yes the debt of eyesight is hearing blessing yes every sound blessing debt is beauty around you blessing yes and each beautiful thing blessing debt what of love acceptance laughter companionship every act of kindness we receive any good thing which enriches us each moment and every blessing another debt food and drink rest and sleep painless moments and pleasures each one every second it lasts blessing wonderful gift and another debt even if were sinless and could stand before god in righteousness my debt would remain unpayable because all that am and all that have is gift existence is gift thinking and feeling and being all gifts what is my debt millions of heart beats and breaths thousands of sunlit days and gentle breezes glorious rains and sparkling stars hundreds of loved ones to share my life journey memories of days gone by good days and ask those whose memories are gone what blessing memory is more debts yes owe god billions and billions many blessings blessings take for granted blessings which assume should have everything have owe to god all things and he writes it all off every debt every good thing he has done and every bad thing have done written off except says jesus except as we pray except unforgiveness except the refusal to give mercy as we receive it except the rejection of his life in us the one debt that must be paid by us is treating others with love and mercy unforgiveness cancels his gracious mercy so says jesus we are all debtors debtors beyond imagining treat others debtors as god the father has treated you forgive them their debts forgive as you have been forgiven ,no

724,it done thank goodness so monkeyman went in on thursday early morning without complaint because he couldn eat or drink or had to wake up early just to go and sit and wait and wait and wait at hospital he is such sweet sweet boy having an aspergers child in the house can help but appreciate his cooperation and non defiant behaviour so very very much it makes his and our life soooo easy know it unfair that compare him and his sister but hey they re siblings it impossible not to notice when one child screams her head off about everything and another says yes mom of course mom to every thing you demand of him so monkeyman got to the hospital and entertained himself on his tablet for hours and hours and watched bit of tv we got to talk to all three the doctors before the op the pediatric gastro enterologist ge answered some of our questions and really calmed my nerves the ph doctor came to discuss the procedure and what gerd is etc and was really surprised when she realised not only do we exactly know and that our whole family has it but that she was the one that did my my eldest daughter and eldest son ph studies 10 years ago as well then came this really really young looking anaesthesiologist it scared my husband bit to trust our son who has had anaesthesia problems into the hands of someone looking like he hasn even finished medical school let alone specialised already but somehow was ok with it thinking that maybe as young dr he would be up to date on all the newest things and it turned out to be true before the operation my husband went to lot of trouble to contact the previous 3 anaesthesiologist that took care of monkeyman the ge doctor asked him to my husband requested list of all the medications they used and we put all of it together on one page which we presented this newest anaestheologist with he listened carefully to the symptoms and progression that monkeyman experienced every time he received anaesthesia it was always the same he would wake up confused like any normal child screaming fighting crying then in time he calmed down and sometimes would fall asleep when he had the pulmonary hypertension he slept for 3 hours after the anaesthesia still this is all normal then about 3 4 hours after the anaesthesia everytime the vomitting starts doesn matter how strong the anti nausea meds they give him during the anaesthesia this continues for the rest of the day gagging and vomitting inbetween nausea then the physical tiredness he can barely lift his head walking to the bathroom is too much to bear he just lies down on the couch and doesn move for hours and hours about 6 hours after anaesthesia the fevers starts this continues for about 24 hours around this time or bit earlier his nose starts to run and it clogs up with his eye tearing exactly like cold the worst isn the symptoms but the fact that you can see this is an ill child that something really is wrong but when you try to tell someone they all say oh but it normal to not feel well after anaesthesia yeah know but this was different the first time he was small child of 2 3 years old and we thought that he must ve come down with bug unrelated to the fact that he had anaesthesia just by chance having it at the same time as he wokes up from anaesthesia the second time it was very fishy to see the exact same progression of symptoms but again thought he must ve came down with bug at the same time as the procedure or that maybe the pipe down his throat was to blame he was 4 then age 6 he was really really ill we wrote it partly off due to the fact that he had pulmonary hypertension and an enlarged heart but still it really bothered us seeing him so very very ill so whenever someone just mentions possible gastroscopy we back pedalled we just didn want to face the anaesthesia again our instinct was to protect our child and putting him through anaesthesia went through everything we knew was good for him our instincts screamed but we knew at some stage it just simply had to be done so when this dr said it needed we told her about our fears and experiences so she asked us to get list of all the medications used in his previous anaesthesia didn even think it possible but all 3 doctors came through for us and when we presented the newest anaesthesiologist with the list he said he believe that it the gas that makes monkeyman so ill after the gastroscopy the gastro enterologist came to talk to us for quite while she such sweet caring doctor anyway she said that the anaesthesiologist believes that monkeyman may have malignant hyperthermia she said it 3 times accentuating it sounds like the anaestheliologist really wanted us to know that he thinks that what it is which makes sense to me when googled it malignant really does mean malignant it scares me big time but at the same time have this huge relief in me one less puzzle to try and figure out possible diagnoses basically it means that gene on one chromosome mutated and makes the body unable to handle gas inhalant anaesthesia the body basically kills itself within hours fortunately monkeyman haven had bad case of it yet just the start of the symptoms like the fever and exhaustion and nausea he must just never ever get gas again then he ll be fine also no cocaine ecstasy or such which don really see as concern at this point know it ll be strange for people to understand the relief of knowing my child probably has malignant hyperthermia but we had this sword hanging over our heads fearing monkeyman next anaesthesia it feels like we have removed that sword now it an enemy we could deal with and we dealt with it it makes me happy and relieved and grateful makes sense so how was monkeyman after the gastroscopy well he was confused for about 30 minutes directly after the operation he fought and tangled all the wires something terrible then he woke up properly watched tv for an hour ate stood up and walked out of the hospital such trooper no nausea until late the night no vomitting no fever unfortunately still the runny nose clogged sinusses and red and teary eye so so much better but not all symptoms gone no lying down all day no abnormal tiredness nothing he ate and drank normally unlike the previous times just normally tired little boy who had 30 minutes of anaesthesia really just normal of course he only got iv anaesthesia not gas but he barely flinched when they put the iv in so all in all such an easy child he asked for daddy to go in with him was really so happy about that it wonderful to see their bond and had more than my share of seeing my babies made to sleep the only thing is now just this runny nose and teary eye and clogged sinusses why would anaesthesia do that to him is it still an allergy is it reaction similar to the malignent hyperthermia is it because his immune system is lower than the average child the gastro enterologist was very happy with everything during the operation she found no structural abnormalities like constriction or growths or such no clear signs of issues except that the stomach was quite red abnormally but non specific red she took biopsies of the throat tummy and intestine she also took lot of bloods she gonna get new baseline for him since the last ones was over year ago and then when she was done the ph doctor inserted the ph study while he was still under so that he was saved that trauma at least thank goodness for caring doctors he didn like the little pipe at all it bothered him quite bit as much as it did me shame man but again he was trooper kept him at home and after 24 hours we went to the ph doctor to take it out she only gave us some prelimenary results she ll send the full report to the ge dr the news wasn good even despite being on high doses of meds 2x day already he still had positive gerd test he refluxed 40x during the day and 20x during the night 7 of those events didn just rise up into the throat but the contends of the stomach very little acid due to the medication moved right into his mouth poor little boy no wonder he complains about nausea and aspirated his stomach contends when he was on less medication so ya our hopes of lowering his medication dossage was dashed she said we simply cannot do that to him it will damage his lungs to the point where it can kill him she said after 10 20 years of aspiration it looks like smokers lungs now we wait for the ge call next week to tell us what the biopsies and bloods shows and her opinion on the reflux report ah well m so good with waiting these days boeboe long road has taught me at least that hahaha no really m ok with the waiting remember how used to complain on this blog about the waiting but ve come long long way have learned patience and perserverance and know nothing ever gets to the point of being fixed so no point in being impatient it not destination it a road with rest stops along the way maybe come to think about it that was the lesson needed to learn maybe that answers the why so many people have asked or mentioned this past few years how come one family could have so many little rare issues they deal with well maybe that was so that could reach this point of acceptance and just founding the joy in the here and now enjoying every day we as family have together ,no

728,patients with heart failure often have buildup of scar tissue that leads to gradual loss of heart function but researchers say they are making progress toward an approach that could shrink the amount of heart scar tissue while replenishing the supply of healthy heart muscle the findings published in the journal cell stem cell came from researchers from the university of north carolina school of medicine our past work brought hope that we could one day improve heart function in people with heart failure by converting scar tissue into beating heart muscle said li qian phd assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and the study senior author but that was more of proof of principle study and the conversion rate was quite low now we have found the barrier to conversion and by removing it we have been able to significantly increase the yield of muscle like cells heart failure has no cure and currently affects an estimated 5 7 million people in the united states common symptoms include shortness of breath fatigue and swelling all of which often worsen as the heart weakens over time our hope is that this approach could extend the lives of people with heart failure and markedly improve their quality of life in the future said qian who is also member of the mcallister heart institute at unc in 2012 qian and her colleagues created cocktail of proteins capable of converting fibroblasts which create scar tissue into cardiomyocytes heart muscle cells that beat on their own exactly the way regular heart muscle cells do notably the team approach did not require converting fibroblasts into stem cells which is typical of other tissue regeneration techniques qian approach lowered the likelihood of uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation in experiments using mice the cocktail proved successful at shrinking the size of scar tissue and improving heart function but the process had remained disappointingly slow until now we wanted to have better yield and shorten the conversion time so in the future this process could be fast easy and efficient for disease modeling or for treatment qian said the new breakthrough came when the team discovered that gene called bmi1 interfered with the expression of other key genes needed to convert fibroblasts into heart muscle cells bmi1 previously had been investigated for its role in neural stem cells and cancer cells but this is the first study to pinpoint role in its interaction with cardiogenic genes when the team depleted bmi1 the conversion rate sped up markedly the percentage of fibroblasts that transformed into heart muscle cells increased 10 fold repressing bmi1 also allowed qian team to simplify the cocktail by reducing the number of different proteins in it ,no

743,written by rachael kaine what is cardiology fellowship there are many different aspects of going to medical school but one of the final and most useful of these steps is attending and completing cardiology fellowship so that you may become licensed practicing cardiologist this last step will teach you in the final ins and outs of the medical care and precision needed to keep the heart healthy throughout your life clinical and academic training make it possible for cardiologists to remain up to date with the newest trends breakthroughs and future possibilities of medical care research is just as important as the hands on clinical experience because these findings can improve the quality of medical care that is provided change the ways that people view the medical community and provide solid basis for future research and modification of the field what can you use cardiology fellowship to do georgetown cardiology fellowship will prepare you for career maintaining and studying the function of the heart and blood vessels that pertain to the heart potential careers include focus on heart disease heart failure and congenital heart disorders that both adults and children suffer from the heart is responsible for supporting the function of the entire body making it essential to keep it healthy by any meas necessary medical training that is obtained by finishing school and performing clinical rotations is always going to be valuable and an asset but this is some of the most important non surgical information that people can possess while not surgeon cardiologist is still specialist for medical matters of the heart and can create implement and help manage different treatment options for patients two of the most popular careers for those that complete the cardiovascular fellowship washington dc are interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists both of these require additional time and training after the initial fellowship but are rewarding and absolutely necessary career paths high blood pressure and high cholesterol are the main causes of damage and stress on the heart and unfortunately these conditions and symptoms are on the rise this increase makes it more necessary for larger numbers of people needed to fill all of the open positions within the field though it is difficult and time consuming to become cardiologist the end result is not only rewarding and worthwhile career choice in terms of the people that you will end up helping but it is financially lucrative one as well ,no

745,invc news new delhi world leading cardio and endovascular technology maker biotronik today introduced in india its latest and most advanced home monitoring technology for patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers implantable defibrillators icds and heart failure devices biotronik home monitoring is an internet based remote monitoring technology that enables physicians to continuously and reliably monitor their patients clinical and device status anytime anywhere and minimize risk of any negative medical event the latest device in the biotronik home monitoring program the cardiomessenger smart is about the size of smartphone and is highly robust more convenient and remarkably portable as compared to previous versions of the device having the pacemaker wearers constantly connected to their physician this home monitoring technology enhances safety for cardiac device patients the device provides fully automatic transmission of vital information from patient cardiac implant to their physician via biotronik home monitoring data are transmitted from the patient implant to the cardiomessenger transmitter device which uses mobile and its partners networks gprs to send data to the biotronik service centre from where the data is sent to the physician home monitoring has helped doctors world over to keep very close look at their patients implanted devices and their cardiac activity it has helped reduced mortality episodes of hospitalizations and inappropriate shocks and helped improve the quality of life of patients immensely it helps use of the full potential of the device that preserves battery life it has also helped reduce routine clinic follow up which can be burden to patients and extra workload for physicians these results formed basis for the class a indication which means this is considered as standard of best care this was the recommendation by the heart rhythm society and is endorsed by the other professional societies around the world including asia pacific heart rhythm society said dr niraj varma electrophysiologist at cleveland clinic ohio usa who co chaired this document dr varma says home monitoring has clinically shown to have helped doctors provide improved services and helped better the health conditions of patients the cardiomessenger smart facilitates the application of home monitoring results from large clinical show the following benefits of home monitoring mortality in heart patients less by 50 hospitalizations due to atrial arrhythmia or stroke less by 66 in office follow ups less by 55 risk of inappropriate shocks in patients with implanted devices less by 52 another advantage of constant remote monitoring is that we as physicians get closer look at trends in different patients some patients might have more stable heart activity with cardiac device others may have more frequent discrepancies and episodes of arrhythmia by regular monitoring data over period of time we can understand each patient and tailor our treatment and advice according to their needs and optimise device function it also helps better our medical understanding and gives vital data for research regular monitoring of patients wearing pacemakers and other devices has traditionally been cumbersome task since patients are required to visit clinics at regular intervals in country like india where patient from bihar might have had device implanted in delhi follow up visits can be very difficult sometimes medical event in between the visits could go unnoticed and be life threatening to the patient home monitoring has made it easy enhanced safety and also reduced cost said dr viveka kumar senior consultant interventional cardiologist director of the cath lab at max hospital new delhi biotronik home monitoring is the only remote monitoring system worldwide with us fda and european ce approval to replace conventional in office follow ups and provide early detection of clinically relevant cardiac events it is the only system with fully automated data transmission no patient interaction is needed leading to the highest possible patient compliance physicians can define the events they wish to be notified with via email sms or fax and view the events in order of importance regular data recording allows significant trend analysis help physicians understand each patient condition and adjust their treatments accordingly the process also allows better scheduling of follow up appointments which may be skipped if not needed digital technology has drastically changed the way we live and its impact on healthcare is also profoundly visible today the indian government special emphasis on digital india shows how it and digitization is inextricably linked to development digitization is bringing revolutionary changes to healthcare delivery across the world including use of telemedicine to reach out to patients in remote areas and make diagnosis results quicker at biotronik we believe that digital technology can be effectively used to benefit large number of patients biotronik home monitoring systems are leveraging this technology not only to improve healthcare delivery but also radically improve the quality of life of our patients cardiomessenger is the latest manifestation of how digital technology can benefit heart patients and help them live longer more productive lives said mr tushar basu managing director biotronik india clinical studies have shown home monitoring makes patients feel more secure improving their quality of life 92 of patients surveyed said it gave them sense of security while 98 believed it had positive impact on their health ,no

747,i was diagnosed with ms in 06 and put on avonex inj for almost year then the mri showed brain lesions and the report said no ms pattern or demylinization my pcp said get another opinion so am waiting to see another neuro dr march 1 have recently had left leg dvt and pe enlarged heart and atrophy of the left ventricle had several other clots as well in my lungs now am confused as to what is going on my rdw is high and my ldh am to have another ct again in 3 weeks am on welfarin am not taking the avonex anymore is this possibly cancer not showing up yet do have fibrosis of the lung as well can you give me some help here mary answer hi mary sorry but we are not allowed to give specific medical advice on this site but will help as much as can how old are you the suggestion to get an opinion by neuro expert is good one think it highly unlikely that the brain lesion is cancer the circulatory and cardiac symptoms are certainly of concern has cardiologist discussed them with you can also see no connection between ms and the lung fibrosis did you have history of other conditions before the ms diagnosis did they rule out lupus or another autoimmune disease do you have any occupational exposure to lung damaging agents or smoking history hope this is of some help am happy to answer more questions or help you interpret what your doctors tell you all the best michael follow up hi michael am prior smoker but quit 9 yrs ago do have copd and have not been tested for lupus is it possible to have lesions with that just want to know what to ask this new neurologist what would be good for mw was told to get another mri of the spinal canal seeing it has been nearly 5 yrs now he was an ms specialist and he said that if the lesions are on the brain they are most likely on the spine too have been told have microvascular changes in the brain and stenosis in the lower legs there is some vascular peticei have not had cardio work up in several years but my nurse came out and suggested do see one seeing do have cardiomegaly and left hypertrophy maybe caused from the clots can get my walfarin stableized yet will find out more when go for my visit march 1 thanks bunch answer hi mary lupus is much more varied disease and can affect many more organ systems in the body but they probably would have considered that previously but it does not hurt to ask the copd would explain the fibrosis in the lungs but don understand shat is causing your clotting problem or the cardiac conditions so it is good that you see cardiologist regularly and the spine mri also seems warranted again don see an obvious connection between the ms and the clotting or heart conditions so that would be one thing to explore with the neurologist hope this has helped bit best of luck michael follow up,yes

preparation results of randomized controlled trial 1 division of gastroenterology faculty of medicine university of calgary calgary ab canada 2 departments of medicine and community health sciences university of calgary calgary ab canada 3 forzani macphail colon cancer screening centre alberta health services calgary ab canada 4 division of gastroenterology faculty of medicine university of ottawa ottawa on canada received 9 august 2015 accepted 4 october 2015 copyright 2016 rachid mohamed et al this is an open access article distributed under the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited abstract background the efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormalities within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy safety and tolerability of peg lavage and split dose peg lavage with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon methods the study was prospective randomized two arm controlled trial of 237 patients patients between the age of 50 and 75 years were referred to an outpatient university screening clinic for colonoscopy patients were allocated to receive either single 4 peg lavage or split dose peg lavage results overall the bowel preparation was superior in the split dose group compared with the single dose group mean ottawa score 3 50 2 89 versus 5 96 3 53 and resulted in less overall fluid in the colon this effect was observed across all segments of the colon assessed conclusions the current study supports use of split dose peg lavage over single large volume lavage for superior bowel cleanliness which may improve polyp detection this trial is registered with clinicaltrials gov identifier nct01610856 1 introduction the efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormalities within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation despite advances in bowel preparation the process remains difficult for patients to tolerate and complete and ultimately if inadequate can result in missed lesions 1 with published literature on missed polyps and carcinomas at colonoscopy 2 4 optimal visualization of the colonic mucosa becomes critically important furthermore some evidence suggests that colonoscopy may not be protective against right sided colonic lesions 5 6 subtle flat lesions with predilection for the proximal colon particularly those with serrated histology are becoming increasingly significant as potential factors for the lack of protection of colonoscopy proximally and stress the importance of adequate preparations 7 10 background polyethylene glycol peg is balanced electrolyte lavage rather than an osmotic agent therefore its use as bowel cleansing preparation is typically associated with fewer fluid shifts and electrolyte abnormalities compared with low volume osmotic agents 11 it has been widely used for colonoscopy preparation on its own 12 16 or in conjunction with other agents 17 20 one disadvantage of the traditional 4 peg bowel preparation is reduction in the quality of cleanliness with afternoon procedures 21 which has driven further research into timing and dosing of peg depending on timing of the procedure 22 26 in our previous study the 4 peg preparation was somewhat inferior to sodium phosphate preparations now removed from the market because it left large amount of residual fluid in the colon 27 however the use of split dose of peg 2 the day before the procedure and 2 the morning of the procedure may alleviate some of the shortcomings of single 4 preparation particularly for afternoon procedures 28 the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of single and split dose peg lavage with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon and the influence of endoscopy time 2 materials and methods all patients between the age of 50 and 75 years referred to the forzani macphail colon cancer screening centre in calgary alberta canada for colonoscopy in 2010 were considered for inclusion during preassessments at the clinic patients were asked to participate in the study by nurse clinician those not interested in participating simply received the centre standard bowel preparation protocol patients with acute coronary syndrome congestive heart failure unstable angina known or suspected renal failure ascites megacolon known or suspected bowel obstruction or other comorbidities that may prevent colonoscopy were excluded patients were also excluded if they previously had partial or subtotal colectomy or if the colonoscopy was warranted for the evaluation of diarrhea enrollment of participants was performed by study coordinator computer was used to generate randomizations table with blocks of 8 allocation concealment was maintained through the use of consecutively numbered sealed envelopes the allocation ratio was 1 1 colonoscopists and investigators were blinded to the allocation groups patients were allocated to one of two groups 1 4 peg the day before the procedure starting at noon for am procedures and 6 00 pm for pm procedures or 2 4 of peg in split dose procedure before 10 am 2 at 12 noon and 2 at 8 pm the day before the procedure procedure after 10 am 2 of peg at 8 pm the day before the procedure and 2 of peg 5 hours before the scheduled procedure time on the day of the procedure study assistant assigned patients to their group and instructed them on the proper use of their assigned bowel preparation method patients were instructed to start low residue diet 4 days prior to the colonoscopy table of acceptable foods white bread white pasta dairy eggs chicken beef pork fish cooked or steamed vegetables and canned fruits and foods to avoid whole grain brown or wild rice oatmeal raw fruits and berries any food containing nuts seeds and popcorn was included in the patient handout patients were instructed to take light breakfast on the morning before the procedure followed by clear fluids thereafter patients were given tolerability questionnaire that was modified from previously reported questionnaire 27 to be completed once their bowel preparation was finished and before coming to the hospital for the colonoscopy patient concerns or questions regarding the preparation were directed to the assistant as opposed to their gastroenterologist so as to avoid unblinding the gastroenterologist 2 1 outcomes the previously validated ottawa bowel preparation scale 29 was used to assess the quality of bowel cleanliness each of the right mid and rectosigmoid colons was rated on 5 point scale 0 4 in addition overall colonic fluid was assessed with 3 point rating 0 2 resulting in an overall score range of 0 to 14 an excellent preparation with little fluid would have score of 0 to 1 and good preparation would have score of 2 to 4 an adequate bowel preparation would have score of 5 or lower and completely unprepared colon would have score of 11 to 14 depending on the amount of colonic fluid colonoscopy was performed in standard fashion and endoscopists rated the bowel preparation quality during the procedure before any attempts to improve visualization and recorded the result on separate standardized form secondary outcomes included tolerability questionnaire as well as patient and investigator reported adverse events 2 2 statistical analyses descriptive statistics were used for baseline characteristics the ottawa bowel preparation scale produces data that are approximately normally distributed two group anova was used to assess for the presence of group differences in the preparation scores while accounting for procedure time am versus pm the proportion of adequate bowel preparation in each group was compared with chi square statistic the secondary endpoints of tolerability were assessed using the mann whitney test 2 3 sample size calculation in our previous study using the ottawa bowel preparation scale an observed effect size of 1 0 was seen 27 for two group anova total sample size of 190 patients would be required for two tailed alpha at 0 05 and an 80 power based on experience from our previous study an additional 20 of patients were added to the total sample size to account for early withdrawals and incomplete colonoscopies 3 results in total 249 patients were enrolled in the study 125 in the split dose group and 124 in the single dose group 237 completed the study 115 patients in the single dose group and 122 patients in the split dose group discontinuations were due to scheduling conflicts no adverse events causing discontinuations were reported table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the two groups there were no significant differences between groups in the split dose group 41 underwent afternoon colonoscopies compared with 40 in the single dose group table 1 baseline characteristics of the patients the differences in ottawa score between the two groups are illustrated in figure 1 in total the bowel preparation was superior in the split dose group compared with the single dose group mean ottawa score 3 50 2 89 versus 5 96 3 53 split dose peg resulted in lower and therefore better mean ottawa score across all segments of the colon assessed as well as

preparation ottawa score 6 than the single dose group 76 2 versus 59 1 figure 2 figure 1 ottawa bowel prep scores for split dose and single dose peg lavage groups by colon segment and overall lower scores are better figure 2 proportion of patients with adequate bowel preparation ottawa bowel prep score 6 for split dose and single dose peg lavage groups split preparations for morning procedures were performed only for those procedures after 10 am as earlier procedures were not feasible to have patients take an early morning dose of their preparation in procedures performed in the morning the split dose peg lavage resulted in lower total ottawa score compared with the single dose lavage mean total ottawa score 4 31 3 13 versus 5 51 3 61 the ottawa score in the right colon was significantly better in the split dose group than in the single dose group 1 51 1 06 versus 1 88 1 08 the differences in ottawa score between the two groups for morning procedures are illustrated in table 2 table 2 mean ottawa scores parameters for morning procedures the effect of the split dose lavage compared with the single dose lavage is amplified in the afternoon procedures the total ottawa score was far superior in the split dose arm 2 34 2 02 versus 6 63 3 33 as were the independent assessments of the different colonic regions right colon 0 82 versus 2 22 mid colon 0 58 versus 1 91 left colon 0 40 versus 1 52 all the differences in total ottawa score with the split dose and single dose peg lavage for both morning and afternoon procedures are illustrated in figure 3 figure 3 bowel preparation quality for am earlier than 10 00 am and pm after 10 00 am procedures all single dose patients took their bowel preparation 4 peg the day before the colonoscopy starting at noon for am procedures and 6 00 pm for pm procedures split dose patients took the second dose the evening before colonoscopy for am procedures or 5 hours before the colonoscopy time for pm procedures both preparations were generally well tolerated and completed as directed by the majority of participants 90 in split dose group versus 85 in single dose group questions regarding tolerability of the lavage preparations are shown in table 3 more patients who took the single 4 lavage would rather have had different preparation method compared with those who took the split dosing the mean number of adverse events experienced during the lavage was higher in the single dose group compared with the split dose group 2 60 versus 2 01 adverse event data are provided in table 4 table 3 questionnaire patient opinion regarding the assigned bowel preparation table 4 adverse events group symptom score 4 discussion administration of peg lavage in two 2 doses is superior to administration in single 4 dose for screening colonoscopy in an outpatient population the result is an overall better cleanliness in all regions of the colon as well as less residual fluid while this holds true for procedures performed throughout the day the effect is amplified when there is shorter interval between the last dose of peg and the procedure as was the case in the afternoon procedures where the second peg dose was given in the morning of the day of the procedure in this situation the difference in total ottawa score between the split dose and single dose preparations was the greatest while there was still significant difference in morning procedures where the last peg dose was given the evening before the effect was less dramatic this begs the question as to whether patients with morning procedures should be asked to take the second peg dose 4 5 hours before the procedure rather than the evening before at least in the setting of colorectal cancer screening clearly this puts significant added burden on patients with scheduled morning procedures there are variety of reasons as to why split dose administration of peg is superior to single dose administration the second dose of the split preparation is given closer to the procedure time than is the single dose the result is likely better removal of fluid and debris that may have accumulated in the hours since the first dose of the peg lavage 22 30 31 the single dose of peg is almost always given the night before the procedure leaving several hours since the laxative was administered for fluid bile and debris to accumulate therefore the bowel becomes less clean over time matro and colleagues have recently shown equivalency for morning only and split dose peg preparation pm am for afternoon procedures suggesting that the earlier dose may not even be required 25 another study found that maximal cleanliness of the bowel preparation was achieved when the colonoscopies were performed within 8 hours of the last laxative dose 30 this notion is supported in our study by the superior bowel preparations in the afternoon procedures the effect was less pronounced in the morning procedures likely because of the increased time between the second dose evening before and the colonoscopy time in our study afternoon procedure cases received the second dose of peg 5 hours priorly better bowel preparation has been associated with higher cecal intubation rates and higher polyp detection rates 30 in study by marmo et al split dose peg lavage outperformed single dose peg lavage for colonoscopy the improved bowel preparations were associated with 5 fold increase in cecal intubation and 2 fold increase in adenoma detection 30 the superiority of the split dose lavage in the right colon shown in this study and others 32 facilitates better identification of the serrated adenomas which tend to be flat and more difficult to detect polyp and adenoma detection rates are typically descr ,no

764, memories taken by alzheimer could possibly be retrieved paracetamol useless in treating osteoarthritis pain paracetamol is next to useless at alleviating arthritic pain the times reports comprehensive review of existing data suggests paracetamol should not be used in cases of osteoarthritis as there are far more effective treatments available osteoarthritis is now the leading cause of joint pain and stiffness in older people the review showed that paracetamol at any dose had very low chance of improving pain linked to osteoarthritis 0 4 chance despite being advised as the painkiller of first choice in current guidance in contrast the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids class of painkillers such as diclofenac 150mg per day and etoricoxib 30 60 or 90mg per day were found more likely to improve pain between 95 and 100 likely and were the top ranked painkilling drugs potential drawback to nsaids is that long term use can trigger complications such as stomach ulcers and in rarer cases heart failure if person is thought to be at risk of stomach ulcers additional protective medication such as proton pump inhibitors may also be prescribed nice the uk health watchdog which issues guidance to doctors is in the process of updating its guidance on drug management of osteoarthritis therefore it is likely that this latest study will feed into the process if you have concerns speak to your doctor do not change prescribed medications without consulting your doctor first not doing so may damage your health lifestyle changes such as losing weight and regular exercise can also help relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis universities in switzerland and canada and was funded by the swiss national science foundation and arco foundation many of the researchers involved in the project reported that they were employed by or had received grants from pharmaceutical companies the study was published medical journal the lancet the uk media reports were generally accurate but largely ignored the good news about nsaids and instead focused on debating whether paracetamol should be used for arthritic pain this is reasonable line to take due to the large numbers of people who use paracetamol to relieve arthritis pain both in the uk and around the world was meta analysis of randomised control trials rcts looking at how effective different drugs were to help lower pain linked to osteoarthritis osteoarthritis is condition that causes the joints to become painful and stiff it is the most common type of arthritis in the uk there is no cure for osteoarthritis but it can be effectively managed the main treatments for osteoarthritis include lifestyle measures such as maintaining healthy weight and exercising regularly medication to relieve your pain including paracetamol and supportive therapies to help make everyday activities easier the analysis found 74 decent sized rcts with over 100 people comparing different nsaids or paracetamol with placebo to improve osteoarthritic pain how well the drugs improved joint movement was also assessed included nsaids that are available in the uk were ibuprofen celecoxib commonly called cox 2 inhibitor etoricoxib commonly called cox 2 inhibitor the analysis also included rofecoxib and lumiracoxib both of which have been withdrawn from the uk market due to safety concerns in total 58 556 people were included in the analysis average median follow up was 12 weeks with large range from one week to one year the researchers used statistical technique called network meta analysis this allows direct and indirect comparisons of drugs for example if one study compared paracetamol with placebo and second compared an nsaid with placebo in similar conditions this technique allows you to estimate the probability that paracetamol works better than the nsaid including these indirect comparisons is useful but not as accurate as trials directly comparing one drug with another sometimes called head to head trials this review included both direct and indirect comparisons the final output was rank of all the nsaids paracetamol and placebo and an estimate of their ability to achieve minimum clinically important difference in pain the minimum difference was defined at set point reduction 0 37 standard deviations within the overall spread of pain reductions for each trial etoricoxib 60mg or 90mg and diclofenac 150mg per day the maximum dose were very likely to improve pain between 95 and 100 likely and were the top ranked nsaids the withdrawn drug rofecoxib was also similarly ranked the bottom of the ranking table was filled with different doses of paracetamol for example the highest ranked paracetamol dose 3g per day was linked to only 21 chance of helping pain to useful level doses less than 2g had only 4 chance of helping pain ranking second to last behind naproxen 750mg concluded on the basis of the available data we see no role for single agent paracetamol for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis irrespective of dose they added we provide sound evidence that diclofenac 150mg day is the most effective nsaid available at present in terms of improving both pain and function nevertheless in view of the safety profile of these drugs physicians need to consider our results together with all known safety information when selecting the preparation and dose for individual patients conclusion this swiss study reviewed drugs commonly used and recommended to help pain associated with osteoarthritis through indirect comparison it identified those likely to be most effective diclofenac 150 mg day and those that are pretty likely to be useless paracetamol any dose the study looked at large number of good sized rcts all with more than 100 people and covered useful range of nsaids the quality of the rcts was also assessed and was generally not highly biased although variable however the review included many indirect comparisons of the drugs which is less accurate and reliable than direct comparisons but without more direct comparisons available this is probably the best we have to go on for now the main implication from the study authors point of view was clear paracetamol has no place in the pain management of osteoarthritis on its own this finding jars with the uk current national guidance that advocates using paracetamol as first choice painkiller alongside other osteoarthritis management the fact paracetamol might not be useful in the pain management of osteoarthritis does appear to be recognised by nice the watchdog that issues guidance on medicines although the current guidance based on 2008 recommendations advocates its use for example nice reports that it is in the process of updating the guidance and hints that paracetamol may be less effective than thought in 2008 nice makes point of saying on its website that an evidence review on the effectiveness of paracetamol as part of consultation exercise showed reduced effectiveness of paracetamol in the management of osteoarthritis compared with what was previously thought the current guideline on pain management in osteoarthritis is due to be updated in september 2016 in the meantime if you have concerns about taking paracetamol for pain linked to osteoarthritis consult your doctor before changing your medications it is also important not to overlook the benefits that lifestyle changes such as achieving healthy weight and becoming more active can bring read more about how exercise and weight loss can help prevent future flare ups

783,in surgery there have been certain periods when advancement in knowledge and technical inventions have had marked effect on our life and the surgeon ability two quantum leaps occurred in the late 19th century which together allowed the transition to modern surgery the first great advancement was the discovery and use of anesthesia especially ether to enable the surgeon to work without causing pain and the inevitable accompanying shock which would be life threatening subsequent new agents and newer delivery methods have eliminated the bad effects of the original drugs an appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery antisepsis which soon gave way to asepsis reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to far more acceptable rate than in previous eras the next major advancement was as the result of the spanish civil war when an understanding of shock and its treatment in traumatic injuries proved to be lifesaving in the post wwii era starting in the late 50s combination of better anesthesia techniques and shock support plus better understand of the body hemostasis led to greater surgical advances to the point where we can now even transplant organs included in these advancement were the use of new visual tools as well as the computer and micro surgical development so called non invasive the first heart valve replacement happen in the 1960 it was rather brutal procedure and took such great toll on the body that the majority who needed the operation the most especially the elderly over 70 had little chance of surviving the operation am unawares of anyone in the 80s being offered the procedure the operation was done by splitting the sternum breast bone down the middle then the heart is exposed the pericardium is opened and the patient is put on cardiopulmonary bypass machine also known as the heart lung machine this machine takes over the task of breathing for the patient and pumping their blood around while the surgeon replaces the heart valve before its invention the heart continued to beat and made it difficult to place the valve further advancement was the addition of the use of hypothermia lowering the body temperature early adoption of this technique proceeded slowly based on the limitations of available replacement valves and relatively primitive techniques for protecting the heart during surgery which were available at the time with the evolution of mechanical heart valves and gradual developments in cardiopulmonary bypass the heart lung machine and cardioplegia which allow the heart to be stopped safely during surgery aortic valve replacement became accepted therapy for patients with severe aortic insufficiency and or regurgitation once the patient is on bypass cut is made in the aorta and cross clamp applied the surgeon then removes the patient diseased aortic valve and mechanical or tissue valve is put in its place once the valve is in place and the aorta has been closed the patient is taken off the heart lung machine transesophageal echocardiogram tee an ultra sound of the heart done through the esophagus can be used to verify that the new valve is functioning properly pacing wires are usually put in place so that the heart can be manually paced should any complications arise after surgery drainage tubes are also inserted to drain fluids from the chest and pericardium following surgery these are usually removed within 36 hours while the pacing wires are generally left in place until right before the patient is discharged from the hospital recovery from this operation usually takes about 3 months or more as medical procedures evolved cardiac cauterization became standard and not only could the heart blood vessels be visualized but the placing of stents instead of open heart coronary heart surgery became possible and common treatment in 2011 only 5 years ago the first aortic valve was replaced by using catheter inserted through the femoral artery and passed into the heart hospitalization was now no more than 5 days if there were no complications which were much less than in open heart replacement now those in the 80s could be treated instead of facing rapid progress heart failure within week or two the patient could depending on his heir status resume normal life these valves folded up so that they could be passed through the catheter and were then open when in the area of the valve to be replaced and anchored into position they consisted of metal framework covered with plastic and the valve itself was usual from pig tissue the metal frame help anchor the valve in place the operation is called trans aortic valve replacement tavr today new and better valve for many reasons is undergoing clinical trial in the usa although it has been in use in europe for about 2 years it has no metal and is secured in place by expanding it as if it were balloon and then hardening polymer is injected to fix it in place if the surgeon does not like its initial positioning he deflates the balloon and reposition it under the ultrasound and fluoroscope guidance before injecting the fixing agent it will be only be matter of time when all valve replacement will be done by this less traumatic method ,no

793,selenium is trace element and mineral that is essential for human life 1 it is critical to many of our basic physiological functions including protecting cells from oxidative stress and helping the thyroid produce hormones it is found in many selenium rich fruits and vegetables and some animal products to say that selenium is important is an understatement low selenium levels are actually linked to conditions such as keshan disease 2 heart disease 3 and infertility 4 let look at what selenium means to your health 1 selenium is powerful antioxidant selenium works as powerful antioxidant in the body 5 antioxidants are substances that slow or prevent cell damage by neutralizing free radicals selenium protects against free radicals and oxidative stress it an active immunomodulator and more potent antioxidant than vitamins c or 6 selenium combines with other proteins to create selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases these proteins act as antioxidants to support health at the cellular level 7 2 thyroid support the thyroid is gland in the throat that produces hormones the hormones produced by the thyroid affect growth and metabolic processes compared to other tissue in the human body the thyroid contains the most selenium per gram 8 like iodine selenium plays an important role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones there have been many studies on selenium and thyroid disease often with mixed or contradictory results one study linked low selenium levels to thyroid problems in the elderly unfortunately in that instance selenium supplementation did little to help 9 however another study found that selenium supplementation during pregnancy reduced hypothyroidism and inflammation 10 yet another study found selenium supplementation decreases the negative effects of hashimoto thyroiditis 11 more research is needed to draw conclusions but the potential of selenium as it relates to thyroid health is encouraging 3 anti aging properties of selenium free radical damage causes the cellular degeneration we know as aging 12 as powerful antioxidant selenium neutralizes the damaging effects of free radicals one study revealed that selenium levels decline with age and low selenium contributes to cognitive decline in older adults 13 14 there is great interest in determining whether selenium supplementation can slow age related mental impairment hopefully we learn more soon 4 encourages metal detoxification metals are among the most toxic of pollutants effective ways to detoxify the body of toxic metals are few and far between the good news data suggests that supplementing with organic carbon bound selenium supports mercury excretion 15 5 cardiovascular support it clear that there is relationship between selenium concentration and cardiovascular health some heart attack patients show low selenium levels 3 and incidences of heart failure caused by selenium deficiency have been reported since as early as 1937 16 not only is selenium itself important for cardiovascular support it works with other nutrients such as vitamin and beta carotene to help promote normal cholesterol levels 17 6 reproductive health selenium is critical for both male and female reproductive health it enables sperm locomotion and selenium deficiency can lead to male infertility 18 studies have found that low selenium can also have negative impact on female fertility and fetal growth 4 there seems to be link between selenium deficiency and miscarriage but more research is necessary to determine the exact mechanism 19 7 selenium and cancer studies have observed trend in which lower concentrations of selenium correlated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer 20 21 although this is an interesting tidbit of information it shouldn be interpreted as an implication that selenium is treatment or method of prevention for cancer while selenium has many benefits there is not conclusive evidence to call it viable treatment option how selenium benefits your health we do know that selenium is an essential mineral that crucial to many bodily functions natural sources like fruits and vegetables are the best way to incorporate selenium into your diet selenium supplementation may also be appropriate for people who are experiencing selenium deficiency 4 if you re concerned that you re not getting enough

801,preoperative diagnosis malignant pleural effusion left with dyspnea postoperative diagnosis malignant pleural effusion left with dyspnea procedure thoracentesis left description of procedure the patient was brought to the recovery area of the operating room after obtaining the informed consent the patient posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion xylocaine 1 was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line initially tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1 xylocaine had been infiltrated but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient very thick chest wall therefore had to use 18 spinal needle which had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid from then on proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 ml of light milky fluid the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle at that time it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after few minutes the patient was feeling fine at any rate we gave her bolus of 250 ml of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation we then thought that if she was doing fine then we will send her home chest ray was performed after the procedure which showed dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure ,yes
802,i am going to share something have shared with very few people and something that has never been put into writing despite many attempts only my wife parents and grandparents know of this the primary reason being that it was such horrible thing to have happened to 9 year old boy that even thinking about it slightly would trigger full blown paralyzing panic attack for over 20 years it is the single most traumatic event in my life am sharing this as form of self therapy speak from personal experience that the way strong trauma affects people can have long lasting and completely unexpected effects was born with terminal heart and lung condition was the third person ever able to be treated for it and the first to ever survive have had five open heart surgeries and more other invasive tests procedures done than could ever even try to count and while part of the truama is that have woken up during couple of those surgeries the event that am going to share with you eclipses even that horror by several magnitudes the point is was in the hospital lot as child and not for small routine things by the time was 7 or 8 pretty much had the floor plan of the hospital memorized knew where was and how to get anywhere else on any of the 20 or so floors of the building was going in for another lifesaving operation when was 9 years old is when it happened the nurses gave me some medication to relax in my hospital room and put me in gurney this was normal for my life and was comfortable and happy as you could be in that situation all while was slowly losing motor control then we went down long corridor to some part of the hospital had never seen before many years later learned that we actually crossed bridge to the next door building which was the other half of the hospital complex but did not know that at this time was suddenly thrust into the unknown in rapidly increasing helpless state as we travel down strange corridors filled with hospital staff actually did not know my anxiety continued to grow by the time we reached our destination was completely incapable of movement or speech but still completely conscious and clear thinking all of my senses were working at 110 but there was no way to signal my distress we were in high end 1980 operating room that was painted dark blue to this day get apprehensive at the sight of that color and flee from any room that mimics it as soon as is reasonably possible have termed the entire experience the blue room as way to talk about it if you need visual aid it looked very much like this but am unable to search for higher quality representative for reasons that should be obvious http blog mediligence com wp content uploads 2009 03 operating room jpg once in the operating room was transferred to the operating table and left there while the doctors and staff prepared for what they were going to do to me right in front of me in plain sight laid there surrounded by terrifying machines whose functions could not comprehend as they got out and filled tray directly in front of me with scalpels forceps bone saws needles tubing and anything else they required could see and hear everything clearly including how they were discussing the very low probability that would even survive this operation at this point am screaming and crying as loud as can in my head don want to do this don want to do this this isn right don want to do this no sound or movement was possible or noticeable to those around me had been rendered silent by the relaxing drink after what am certain was several minutes of this lost my vision everything went black but was still conscious for at least another couple of minutes my last thought was me crying don want to do this and then died am not saying that for dramatic effect that was the only way my therapists 20 years later could help me come to terms with it it took us over dozen 1 2 hour long sessions just for me to even get to the point that could think about the entire incident without being crying mess for often several hours obviously survived and even thrived to certain degree as am now 34 years old but this was such bad time that actually blocked it from my memory for those 3 years until after the second incident the blue room event was directly related to another similar incident nearly 3 years later when was 11 was again going to have another operation and this time it was in similar operating room but this time it was painted brown call this one the brown room to differentiate the place and event enough to be able to discuss it keep in mind by 11 years old was literally an emaciated 90 pound weakling in heart failure who could not walk up several flights of stairs without resting was placed on the metal operating table only this time had not been rendered helpless by being given something to relax my mother was also in the operating room this time as well before the staff prepared like said they knew us and she was an rn anyway was perfectly fine for at least few minutes when suddenly started to feel fear did not know what was happening or why felt this way but it continued to grow in strength quickly with no external source could discern my mother first noticed and tried to calm me but her words had no effect then an orderly came in and decided to try and restrain me that was mistake exploded all these years later still remember having one crystal clear realization at that moment am not helpless this time can fight at the time did not even understand what this time meant but fought and fought viciously my sole consuming desire was to get out of that room and kill anything that got in my way including my own mother am certain that caused at least some minor injuries to the orderly and his 4 friends who helped him restrain me until they were able to get me sedated all of them were bigger men than am today after that operation remembered the first incident but the two events were linked in my mind in some way could not understand could not think of one without thinking of the other and the terror just fed on itself until it burned itself out anything could trigger it but seeing that dark blue color or certain parts of hospital always did could be having panic attacks that lasted hours because of this it has effected me today cannot be bound or rendered incapable of movement and cannot be awake when enter an operating room if such things happen then immediately go into the kind of reaction as in the brown room the only thing will be concerned with is getting free and will kill anything or anyone in my way regardless of who they are it is automatic cannot control it until get free of the situation and can calm down the good news is that in way the brown room was an empowering event learned that if something bad ever happened or if was ever attacked could actually stand my ground and if not win at least give as good as got regardless of being disabled or not

added sugars is an essential part of clean eating distinguishing between natural and added sugars in prepared foods can be confusing for consumers that why some consumer groups are petitioning the food and drug administration fda to require disclosure of added sugars on nutrition labels how much is okay the world health organization who recommends no more than 6 teaspoons 25 grams of added sugar day ditch refined grains refined grains are less nutritious because they have been stripped of their bran and germ the most fibrous parts of the plant as in fruit the fiber in grains is what slows the absorption of sugars when blood sugar levels rise too quickly the result is spike in insulin which over time can increase your risk of diabetes there has been lot of backlash against the idea that refined grains are less healthy especially white rice but we stand firm whole grains are simply the healthier choice choose whole grains like whole wheat steel cut or rolled oats brown rice quinoa amaranth flax and barley watch salt intake americans consume far more salt on average than the recommended 1 500 mg maximum per day sodium easily hides in packaged foods sometimes in surprising quantities read nutrition labels carefully and choose wisely when seasoning homemade food start with herbs spices citrus and vinegar and then add salt you might be surprised at how much salt you add to food while cooking high sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure stroke heart disease heart failure choose minimally processed foods all food has been processed to some extent even fresh fruits and vegetables must be harvested cleaned and in some cases polished before they make it to your local market how do you know food has been minimally processed good rule of thumb is to choose packaged foods and healthy snacks with ingredients you can pronounce fruit and nut bar that contains ingredients like dates cherries almonds and walnuts in other words easily identifiable ingredients is good choice avoid heavily processed foods with laundry list of ingredients especially unrecognizable ones pick your fats wisely in years past dietary fat had bad rap the low fat craze led to fats being removed from packaged foods only to be replaced by sugar which as we discussed above is not good substitute today we know that not all fats are created equal and that good fat the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated varieties are essential for health industrial made fats including trans fats should be avoided trans fats are byproduct of hydrogenation which involves forcing hydrogen molecules into oil to turn it into solid at room temperature and prevent rancidity good for shelf life bad for your arteries on food labels you ll typically see trans fats as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil these fats increase your bad ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol which can clog arteries and lead to host of health problems what about saturated fats these are mostly solid at room temperature and are found in foods like red meat butter whole milk and palm oil americans generally consume more saturated fats than they should although whether saturated fats are bad for us is still hotly contested the latest report released by the world health organization has linked processed meats with an increased cancer risk your best bet is opting for products that contain expeller pressed or cold pressed vegetable oils and better yet monounsaturated oils from avocados nuts and nut butters olives and high oleic variety sunflower oil increase vegetable intake pile those veggies onto your plate most of us don get enough vegetables every day the usda recommends 2 3 cups of vegetables per day for women and 3 cups per day for men but go ahead and eat more we dare you it easier than you think dress your sandwich with lettuce and tomato whip up veggie fruit smoothie after workout tuck bag of baby carrots in your bag and up the amount of veggies in your stir fry there are myriad of ways to increase your daily intake of veggies cut back on the booze cook with wine sometimes even add it to the food c fields most of us by now have heard the reports that moderate alcohol consumption may help protect against cardiovascular disease this is because moderate levels of alcohol increase levels of high density lipoprotein hdl our good cholesterol the problem comes in defining what constitutes moderate drinking whether it one drink per day or three is contested even among alcohol researchers here are some good rules to follow stay within the recommended one drink per day for women or two for men avoid binge drinking sorry folks imbibing your weekly allotment of adult beverages on saturday night isn part of moderate drinking program just say no to fruity drinks loaded with sugar cut back on meat and dairy most americans eat far more meat and dairy than is recommended by the usda many of us don know what our daily protein needs are which is part of the problem the average woman needs just 46 grams of protein day while man needs around 56 grams day that less than two ounces six ounce steak contains as much protein as woman needs for an entire day but that same six ounce steak comes with increased risks from carcinogens and saturated fat unlike other sources of protein such as beans peas lentils nuts grains and even some leafy green vegetables we ve been told since we were little to drink our milk for strong bones but many might be surprised to learn that dairy may actually leach calcium from bones and three quarters of the world is lactose intolerant best to cut back on meat and dairy consumption and up alternative sources of protein like beans nuts and protein packed veggies and grains up your fruit intake it a common misconception that we should limit our fruit intake because fruit contains sugar in our first tip we explained the importance of the fructose to fiber ratio the fiber content in fruit helps the body absorb sugar more slowly so go ahead indulge in daily doses of delicious fruitiness and don forget that all natural snacks like fruit bars made from fruit juices and purees count toward your daily fruit intake drink more water water is essential for every single one of our bodily functions it also flushes toxins from the body plain water is the best option for staying hydrated but fruits and vegetables with high water content such as watermelon lettuce and tomatoes can also help you stay hydrated your water needs can vary dramatically depending on the season and your level of physical activity but at minimum strive for 8 8 that is eight 8oz glasses day use this hydration calculator to determine your specific hydration needs eating clean is about taking control of your health and understanding how our

818,not for me snopes it is known robert atkins did indeed weather heart attack during his lifetime in april 2002 the diet guru issued statement saying he was recovering from cardiac arrest related to heart infection he had suffered from for few years he said it was in no way related to diet however revelations in february 2004 from the city medical examiner report let slip the information that atkins had suffered heart attack congestive heart failure and hypertension before his death the report was given to the journal by the physicians committee for responsible medicine group that advocates vegetarianism because the medical examiner office is claiming this information was circulated in error it may not be possible at this time to determine if what was in that report referred to events that immediately preceded and therefore might have caused the doctor death or if they were in reference to damage done over the course of lifetime the report had been sent to doctor in nebraska who requested it it was later discovered the person it was sent to was not the treating physician and so should not have had access to the report at present the medical examiner office will only say atkins died of head injury from the fall can comment on people previous conditions it against the law said spokeswoman ellen borakove it needs be kept in mind that even if the medical examiner office does become more forthcoming it still may not be able to answer the question of whether heart attack brought about the demise of dr atkins an autopsy was not performed on him because of family objections to the procedure consequently the medical examiner conducted only an external exam and review of atkins hospital records ,no
819,name of procedure 1 left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography 2 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery history this is 58 year old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort the patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of myocardial infarction the patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization procedure details informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion 2 xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region using modified seldinger technique 6 french arterial sheath was placed then the patient had already been on heparin then judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed 3drc catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed then 3drc guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery then universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery integrilin was given then 3 0 12 voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds then projection was obtained then 3 0 15 vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery the stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds post stent the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection then there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful then pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion then attempt to place the 2 0 8 power saver across the lesion was performed however it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed then the stent delivery system was removed pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed then pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed then the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an angio seal was applied the patient was transferred back to his room in good condition findings 1 hemodynamics the opening aortic pressure was 116 61 with mean of 64 the opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end diastolic pressure of 23 lv pressure on pullback was 106 with end diastolic pressure of 21 aortic pressure was 111 67 with mean of 87 the closing pressure was 110 67 2 left ventriculography the left ventricle was of normal cavity size and wall thickness there is mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis the overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40 and 45 the mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation the aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally 3 coronary angiography the left main is normal caliber vessel this bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries the left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease the left anterior descending is large vessel that extends to the apex it gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches the first diagonal branch was large the left anterior descending had mild irregularities but no high grade disease the left circumflex is nondominant vessel which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches the two obtuse marginal branches are large there is relatively small left atrial branch the left circumflex had 50 stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch the rest of the vessel is moderately irregular but no high grade disease the right coronary artery appears to be dominant vessel which gives rise to three right ventricular branches four posterior lateral branches two right atrial branches and two small conus branches the right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high grade disease however distal between the second and third posterolateral branch there is 90 stenosis the rest of the vessels had mild irregularities but no high grade disease then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in 20 residual stenosis then after stent placement there was 0 residual stenosis however there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch then wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow there is improvement from timi grade 2 to timi grade 3 flow clinical impression 1 successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery 2 two vessel coronary artery disease 3 elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure 4 mild anterolateral and moderate inferoapical hypokinesis recommendations 1 integrilin 2

827,re anyone take blood pressure medication mv2005 quote but can see how stress can harden the arteries and make it harder to pump annoys me because as said ve always prided myself on being in shape but feels like backed genetic loser here think of it this way your blood pressure represents in one respect the force your heart has to overcome to push blood around your body this isn a bad thing if it intermittent for example when your blood pressure is higher during exercise but if it 24 7 that appears to predispose person to damage their blood vessels leading to atherosclerosis and it also can lead to an enlarged diseased heart and ultimately heart failure your blood pressure is the product of cardiac output how much blood is being pumped and total peripheral resistance in essence the volume of blood vessels the blood is being pushed through stress induces sympathetic nervous system response in your body that increases cardiac output by causing your heart to beat faster and harder and causes vasoconstriction around the body which lowers the volume of the tubes for the blood to travel through thereby increasing total peripheral resistance hence it increases blood pressure and yes lot of high blood pressure has nothing to do with lifestyle ,no

834,cheese 101 or why the french were right the command say cheese is phrase so commonly used to elicit smile that today it is understood from the simple imperative cheese but prior to the 1940s such photographic cajolery was unknown indeed in the preceding victorian era the desirable beauty standard was considered tightly pursed orbicularis oris muscle whether because of poor dentition or the prim and proper societal norms of the time or some combination of both smiles were only for children peasants and drunks and until very recently the prevailing conventional wisdom for healthy eating relegated consuming cheese to failing of the ignorant simple or misguided from the late 1940s through the 1970s there was mandate from the experts and powers that be to consume less fat and particularly saturated fat principally those derived from animal sources such as meat poultry and dairy that admonishment has continued to echo and drive our poor culinary choices over the ensuing half century like an unresolved daddy issue an uncomplicated historical glance would have revealed that modest living fermented food like real cheese had helped sustain and advance human kind across civilizations and across the globe while large portion of the world population is lactose intolerant and therefore unable to consume or potentially benefit from raw or fresh milk products cheeses and particularly aged cheeses are an exception the milk sugar or lactose is utilized by beneficial bacteria lactobacillus comes to mind along with the fats most of which are saturated and proteins and through the process of fermentation raw milk undergoes the transformation from raw milk product to cheese as certain cheeses age there is often less lactose present so much so that for many even those who are lactose intolerant and unable to tolerate fresh milk such delicious pillows of probiotic loaded goodness can be enjoyed for the last half century real cheeses have been discounted as part of healthful approach to eating primarily because of their saturated fat and cholesterol content while the mediterranean diet was promoted as an ideal dietary model the dairy aspect of this gastronomy was shoved into corner where it lingered and mouldered often unappreciated is the historical fact that fermented dairy had long and prominent place in ancient diets such as the mediterranean this is because while fresh milk can be consumed it is quite perishable and much more valuable as raw material raw milk can be turned into several products like cream butter yogurts kefir whey and cheese all of which have substantially longer shelf life cheese reemerged from the shadows with the insights gleaned from the french paradox of the 1990s the french who drank wine and consumed butter cream and over 100 different kinds of cheese most of which are oh so stinky good all these tasty bits that were verboten in the us at the time had significantly less cardiovascular disease it turns out it was more than the wine dietary approach like mediterranean style cuisine rich in natural wholesome and fermented foods has been shown to reduce generalized inflammation and stress oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in the onset and development of the diabetes and its precursor metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of central obesity and at least two of the following four additional factors high triglycerides low hdl or good cholesterol high blood pressure or increased fasting plasma glucose concentration data from the recent european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic study examined 16 835 healthy and 12 403 diabetic participants from 8 european nations the researchers found an inverse association between cheese fermented dairy consumption and the incidence of diabetes eating only 55 d total of cheese and or yogurt was associated with 12 reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes new study just released revealed that just 30 daily of parmesan like italian cheese grana padano lowered blood pressure as effectively as the typically prescribed antihypertensive pharmaceutical this occurred even though the cheese contained the equivalent amount of sodium that would be found in consuming 1 ounce serving of potato chips previous studies had isolated some particular tripeptides in certain types of cheese and demonstrated relationship to being able to lower blood pressure these particular compounds are formed through the interaction of human gastrointestinal enzymes and the gut microbiota these peptide complexes have angiotensin converting enzyme inhibiting properties such ace inhibitors constitute an important class of medications that not only lower blood pressure but are foundation of therapy from those suffering from cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure from variety of causes another study examined almost 20 000 participants it examined the association between cheese consumption in various age groups and circulating concentrations of hdl or good cholesterol and triglycerides negative risk factor for cardiovascular disease the more cheese consumed the higher the hdl and the lower the triglycerides the researchers suggested that this was the result of the particular fatty acid composition of cheese and its inherent probiotic bacterial content the high protein and probiotic content of cheese is also believed to contribute to its almost neutral effect on plasma cholesterol even though cheese is high in cholesterol and saturated fat like so many other such natural foodstuffs its impact on blood lipids and total cholesterol is negligible some kinds of cheeses namely those infected with penicillium such as roquefort stilton or gorgonzola exhibit high concentrations of andrastins b and these are potent inhibitors of the enzyme farnesyltransferase this enzyme plays key role in cholesterol synthesis and its inhibition decreases cholesterol production in fact while the total cholesterol is overall minimally unchanged some studies suggest that consuming these types of foods shift the cholesterol towards the less inflammatory less atherogenic type an interesting observation arises from these studies the decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation markers is independent of body weight eating fat does not make you fat nor are the benefits simply the result of losing weight or caloric considerations the healthful effects also occur quite rapidly which suggests not just correlation but causation oligosaccharides which are also present in cheeses are prebiotics this is the food that sustains healthy gut microbiota it is what feeds the wee beasties cheeses which contain both prebiotics and probiotics become that gut microbiome superfood synbiotic another recently completed study demonstrated the cheese consumption directly altered the gut microbiome in an extremely favorable way certain gut bacteria are associated with the production of compound known as trimethylamine oxide or tmao the bacteria produce this compound in response to the dietary ingestion of choline levels of tmao have been found to correlate and are directly predictive of cardiovascular risk the consumption of cheese rapidly altered the composition of the gut microbiome there was significantly less tmao produced the positive changes to the gut microbiome associated with the regular consumption of such powerful wholesome naturally fermented synbiotic food as cheese may explain the relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease in high cheese consumption countries canned smiles and canned cheese don cut it for that unique stinky goodness and real wellbeing only real cheese is the real deal smile and cut the cheese https www psychologytoday

844,originally posted by krom if we adopt this pragmatic approach which is fine and ignore the philosophy ontology you are still left with explaining how race is useful to science so far no race realist has ever managed to explain what use race has take for example medicine race has no utility whatsoever these big groups that we characterize as races are too heterogeneous to lump together in scientific way if you re doing dna study to look for markers for particular disease you can use caucasians as group they re too diverse naggert 2000 arbitrarily dividing humans into caucasoids negroids and mongoloids is not useful in medicine since these groupings are too heterogeneous keith norris groups that self identify as given race may share biologic characteristics that originated as result of shared ancestry for example persons of african descent in the united states who self identify as black or african american are more likely to have certain biologic traits that were ancestrally protective in africa such as heterozygosity for sickle cell disease which helps to protect against malaria or the newly described apol1 gene which protects against trypanosomiasis science 329 841 45 2010 of course the allele that conveys malaria protection in heterozygotes causes sickle cell disease in those carrying two copies and persons homozygous for the protective form of apol1 are at increased risk for kidney failure thus in settings where malaria and trypanosomiasis are rare these biological traits are disadvantageous and may impart adverse health consequences other examples of biology correlating with race include the disparity among racial groups in the incidence of adverse effects noted with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors class of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure when these drugs are used there are higher rates of angioedema in blacks than nonblacks and higher rates of medication discontinuation owing to drug induced cough in both blacks and asians more recently colleagues and reported racial and age differences in mortality rates for persons with end stage renal disease treated with dialysis most us minorities especially at the higher end of the age spectrum paradoxically showed increased longevity clin am soc nephrol 8 953 61 2013 further cassianne robinson cohen at the university of washington and colleagues found that lower serum vitamin concentrations were associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease among white or chinese participants but not among black or hispanic participants jama 310 179 88 2013 the role of race in medicine these and related findings clearly support the presence of race related variations in disease risk disease progression treatment response and treatment related side effects as such there remains an important role for race ethnicity as marker for ancestry and often for culture as well as other sociodemographic traits in characterizing patients with respect to medical care these variables can be helpful in understanding key aspects of health beliefs health behaviors access to care and likely response to therapeutic interventions at the same time we must be mindful that generalizations filtered through the lens of race ethnicity and other sociodemographic factors should not be used indiscriminately in the setting of increasing admixture within and across racial ethnic groups in diversifying united states there is lack of concordance between today patients and traditional racial stereotypes fortunately genomic data are already beginning to predict disease risk and treatment response and advances will no doubt continue to improve their accuracy the ultimate goal is to arrive at point where medicine becomes so personalized that it is driven from fingerprint of one biologic makeup not from racial typecasting we are still several steps away from such reality for now the inclusion of race and ethnicity in medical research like age gender and other characteristics inches us closer to system of personalized medicine that will truly embrace the multiple dimensions that influence our health and well being keith norris is nephrologist at the university of california los angeles he was the founding principal investigator for the first nih funded national translational research network dedicated to reducing health disparities and he currently serves as the editor in chief of ethnicity and disease and as an associate editor for the journal of the american society of nephrology http scholar google com scholar j6alkqgqmigzaa medicine race problem http www hoover org research medicines race problem,no
845,worse manager ever ls out of richmond ugh what self centered like to hear myself speak on conference calls egotistical narcissistic bitch it is hard to believe she is nurse doesn have one single nursing quality after reading this article however the area managers are just reflection of what comes from the top down get clue novartis karma will get you and it is already salivating at your ankles clouds gather over novartis as it battles series of setbacks andrew ward in london and ralph atkins in zurich joe jimenez is facing battle to restore investor confidence in novartis after series of setbacks which have sent shares in the swiss pharmaceuticals group down more than quarter in the past year disappointing sales of new heart drug have combined with problems in the group alcon eyecare business to create arguably the rockiest period for mr jimenez since the american took charge six years ago legal risks have added to the gloom as novartis faces investigation for suspected marketing abuses in the us south korea and turkey on top of recent cases in japan and china all these problems have been brewing for months but the heat has turned up in the past few weeks as succession of analysts cut growth forecasts for the group mr jimenez still has credit with investors for asweeping overhaul in which novartis has narrowed the sprawling range of businesses built by his predecessor daniel vasella he is likely to trumpet progress towards cutting costs and restructuring alcon when the group announces first quarter results on thursday however the headline numbers are unlikely to part the clouds hanging over novartis analysts expect sales and profits to be down as the eyecare business continues to drag on performance the mood was much different year ago when the group was preparing to launch entresto much anticipated treatment for heart failure data showing that the drug cut deaths by fifth in clinical trials fuelled confidence that it would be the new blockbuster novartis desperately needed to offset the looming loss of patent protection on its best selling gleevec cancer drug yet instead of the expected gush sales of entresto started at trickle the 5m registered in the final quarter of 2015 was less than tenth of analysts forecast they have described the launch as glacial and huge disappointment novartis declined to comment citing the quiet period ahead of its results but analysts sympathetic to the group point out that mr jimenez was always clear that it would take time for entresto to gain momentum there has so far been no retreat from his long term target for peak annual sales of 5bn from the drug others are no longer as confident citigroup last month slashed its entresto sales forecast from 10bn in 2025 to just 2bn the worry for investors is that entresto weak start may be harbinger of tougher times ahead in the us two much hyped cholesterol lowering drugs from sanofi andamgen have also been stuck in the slow lane since their launch last year this has added to evidence that us insurers and healthcare providers are becoming more aggressive in their bargaining with big pharma as structural changes in the health system increase incentives for cost savings without strong contribution from entresto this year novartis has been left badly exposed to decline at alcon business acquired from nestl for 50bn in two part transaction completed in 2010 mr jimenez announced change of leadershipat the unit in january and narrowed its focus to contact lenses and surgical equipment while its eye drugs were transferred to the main pharma division target was set for alcon to return to growth by the end of the year and mr jimenez insisted that eyecare remained an attractive market given rising demand from an ageing world population however seamus fernandez analyst at leerink says the business may be sold if the turnround falters further uncertainty comes from the series of investigations facing novartis over suspected marketing abuses in the us turkey and south korea that is on top of 25m settlement paid to the us securities and exchange commission last month for bribery in china and suspension of its business in japan last year as punishment for manipulating clinical trial data by far the biggest peril is from lawsuit being pursued by preet bharara the formidable us attorney general for the southern district of new york he has accused novartis of funnelling kickbacks to prescribers through as many as 80 0000 sham educational meetings where doctors were wined and dined mr bharara has already secured 390m settlement from novartis in separate case last year and andrew baum analyst at citigroup says there is high probability of another fine that could be similar in scale to the record 3bn paid byglaxosmithkline to the us justice department in 2012 like gsk novartis might also have to commit to marketing reforms that would make it harder to aggressively push entresto mr baum said this could severely impact earnings and cast reputational shadow over the incumbent novartis chairman joerg reinhardt and ceo in an attempt to clean up novartis has appointed chief ethics officer and is in the process of tightening its rules on relations with doctors for all the challenges some analysts still see reasons for optimism while entresto has flopped so far another new product cosentyx for psoriasis has started strongly with forecasts of 2 5bn in annual sales by 2020 michael nawrath analyst at rcher kantonalbank says mr jimenez could refresh the business with bolt on deals it doesn have to be mega merger but there are smart asset swaps collaborations or purchases which could convince shareholders that there is future growth ,no

850, great use of vocabulary it still doesn negate the underlying contentions and reasoning for why obesity isn recognised in positive manner in society if we are here to talk about obesity in symbolic manner let me offer different spectrum could obesity be representative of privileged life with access to an abundance of food which correlates to economic prosperity is it not indicative of first world physique we have individuals who are suffering from malnutrition in regions of africa who we emphatically donate to for the greater good and for humanity and rightly so yet we move onto the opposite spectrum and see individuals who have no solid control over their eating habits and we suddenly correlate such thing with artistry no that isn fair and by blending artistry with obesity doesn negate the negative impacts it may have there a big difference between being overweight and being morbidly obese it is the latter that should not be treated in positive life the underlying contention of having positive body image is certainly admirable but we must be able to realise the reality we live in in the end we are human beings who have the capacity to suffer chronic illnesses and heart failure due to myriad of injuries rampant obesity could certainly be correlated with unhealthy eating which correlates to possible clogging of arteries leading to possible heart attack as one example these health effects are often not cognisant with the unwary until it happens to them which have had the personal unfortunate experience of knowing someone with such illness it not pretty face don necessarily disagree with the premises of body image and reducing depression but m also realist and that individuals have the opportunity to lose weight there is fine line between being overweight and being morbidly obese which should not be forgotten ,no

857,quote originally posted by mysticphd okay let test this what would your reaction be to the idea that the artificial constructs and operations in mathematics manipulating various measures of our reality can serve as abstract clues to the underlying composition of reality itself not just as predictive models of other measurable phenomena typically users of mathematics seldom consider the philosophical implications of the formulae as indices of the actual underlying composition of reality as an example of what am referring to the twin but distinct formulae mc 2 and hf have different uses and different units of measurement etc but they represent manifestation of the underlying unified field that comprises our reality the field manifestations we call energy mass momentum depending upon the application they are used and measured in are essentially equivalent as einstein revealed do you think we can draw any conclusions about the underlying composition of our reality from them quote originally posted by mitchellmckain my reaction is to tell you am not logical positivist whose program to divorce scientific language from metaphysical concepts was failure metaphysics the study of reality is not something conducted by scientific methodology and is therefore not science by the modern definition however science cannot be isolated from the metaphysical and epistemological foundations upon which it was derived this only goes to say that science does not and cannot hold itself up by its own bootstraps not that either of these philosophical endeavors share in the accepted epistemological superiority of science nevertheless science requires such philosophical groundwork and generally relegates such efforts to creative interlude given names like scientific visualization understand your clarification of your position it is encouraging quote guess am straying little from your question so perhaps more to the point should say this while science is defined by very restrictive methodology philosophy is much less restrictive and religion has no general defined methodology at all the result is not only considerably more diversity of opinion in philosophy and religion but also while religion and philosophy for the most part as well cannot inform science the opposite is not the case science certainly can and does inform both philosophy and religion guess in summation am saying yes to your question it can but this does not impart scientific status to these philosophical and religious conclusions good we agree quote don know why you claim such thing this has certainly never applied to me and it seems to me that scientists do this quite frequently what is true is that they know the difference between such speculations and proper science perhaps it was more strongly worded than intended my experience is they typically know the difference but have no interest or desire to even engage the speculations seeing no practical relevance in them although many simply see the artificial constructs as models of quantitative representations of processes and phenomena not as indicators of any underlying composition of reality quote of course do mean this is something that do but while many might see unified field as the underlying reality think the evidence is greater for underlying reality to be something more of geometrical nature for example 1 general relativity pretty much reduces gravitational fields to the geometry of space time 2 kaluza and klein showed that this can include electromagnetism by simply extending gr to 5 dimensions 3 string theory theory reduces all the different particles e fields to the vibrational modes strings and higher dimensional branes the geometry of spacetime is fraught with complications that arise from the very nature of our thoughts and the quantum formation time that underpins our delayed experience of our instantaneous awareness that creates the phenomena of spacetime we can touch on that later it is true that multidimensional speculations provide the advantage of increasing degrees of freedom to represent reality but am lover of four dimensional world or as minkowski called it die vierdimenionsale velt once we start speculating beyond those dimensions almost anything can be represented string theory has the vibratory nature of reality down but they create virtual impossibility to ever empirically test their formulations we can only really measure in four dimensions quote of course there is always the possibility that what we have is two complementary representations of the same thing this often implies that reality is other than what we visualize and the closest we can get is two different images which only partially capture the reality of the thing you know like how photons electrons and such are both particles and waves at the same time yes they are complementary representations that reveal that our underlying reality is actually nothing more than vibratory manifestations of field this along with quantum mechanics seems to suggest that particles are simply events we measure and not actual material substance existing through time this has unsettling implications for our macro experiences as well it would seem even we are merely vibratory events existing as some manner of aggregate spherical standing waveforms whose permanence is illusory am pleased that we do seem to be on similar wavelength to egregiously punish pun quote s mc 2 and hf do not in of themselves have different units but any equation can used in different units if you so choose the dimensions remain the same but the units or measuring yardsticks you use is arbitrary and can thus be altered agree but that is ancillary to the point wanted to make using them as indices of the composition of our reality ,no

864,history the patient is 10 1 2 year old born with asplenia syndrome with complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava complete atrioventricular septal defect total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right sided atrium and double outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels the aorta being anterior with severe pulmonary stenosis he had undergone staged repair beginning on 04 21 1997 with right modified blalock taussig shunt followed on 09 02 1999 with bilateral bidirectional glenn shunt and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation these procedures were performed at medical college hospital family states that they moved to the united states evaluation at the children hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery he was also found to have elevated glenn pressures at 22 mmhg transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmhg the qp qs ratio of 0 6 1 large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated the patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel description of procedure after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia the patient was prepped and draped cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets vascular entry was by percutaneous technique and the patient was heparinized monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg continuous pulse oximetry and cycled cuff blood pressures in addition to intravascular pressures using 6 french sheath 6 french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle using 6 french sheath 5 french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing 5 french sheath percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted but unsuccessful ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein using percutaneous technique and 5 french sheath 5 french wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire this catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein the catheter was then exchanged over wire for 4 french bernstein catheter which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of small right lower pulmonary artery there was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right glenn the jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over wire for 6 french flexor sheath which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava the bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using terumo guidewire probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery the angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis the distal pulmonary measured approximately 5 5 to 60 mm in diameter with long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length the length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra thin sd 4 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist this facilitated advancement of flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis pg 2960 bpx genesis stent premounted on 6 mm optiprobe balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with near complete disappearance of proximal waist angiogram demonstrated good stent apposition to the caval wall further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra thin sds 8 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of distinct proximal waist angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery the balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the optiprobe 6 mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of distinct waist repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery the proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using pg 2980 bpx genesis stent premounted on 8 mm optiprobe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing pg 1870 bpx genesis stent premounted on 7 mm optiprobe balloon catheter repeat angiograms were then performed attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with contrast filling of left sided azygos vein selective angiogram demonstrated large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9 4 mm in diameter an amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein once stable device was confirmed the device was released from the delivery catheter the 4 french bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0 038 inch 10 cm 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins the innominate vein superior vena cava the main pulmonary artery and azygos vein after angiography two normal appearing renal collecting systems were visualized the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition there were no complications discussion oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79 the pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmhg in 30 oxygen remaining saturations reflected complete admixture there was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end diastolic pressure of 9 mmhg left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta phasic ascending descending pressures were similar and normal mean glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmhg with transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmhg the calculated systemic flow was normal pulmonary flows reduced with qp qs ratio of 0 6 1 the pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4 4 woods units following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery there was slight increase in the glenn venous pressures to 16 mmhg following embolization of the azygos vein there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84 and increase in mixed venous saturation there was similar increase in glenn pressures to 28 mmhg with transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmhg there was an increase in arterial pressure the calculated systemic flow increased from 3 1 liters minute meter squared to 4 3 liters minute meter squared angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava there appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of 1 mmhg mean pressure gradient there was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery final angiogram with contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed forward flow through the right glenn good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery and widely patent left glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow initial diagnoses 1

874,procedures performed 1 left heart catheterization 2 bilateral selective coronary angiography 3 left ventriculography 4 right heart catheterization indication positive nuclear stress test involving reversible ischemia of the lateral wall and the anterior wall consistent with left anterior descending artery lesion procedure after risks benefits and alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained in detail to the patient informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion 1 lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery and vein once adequate anesthesia has been obtained thin walled 18 gauge argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance small nick was then made in the skin the pressure was held the needle was removed over the guidewire next 6 french arterial sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance the guidewire and dilator were then removed the sheath was flushed next an angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under the direct fluoroscopy visualization with the use of guidewire the catheter was then guided into the left ventricle the guidewire and dilator were then removed the catheter was then flushed lvedp was measured and found to be favorable for left ventriculogram the left ventriculogram was performed in the rao position with single power injection of nonionic contrast material lvedp was then remeasured pullback was performed which failed to reveal an lvao gradient the catheter was then removed next judkins left 4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of guidewire the guidewire was removed the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed the ostium of the left main coronary was unable to be engaged with this catheter thus it was removed over guidewire next judkins left 5 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of guidewire the guidewire was removed the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed left main coronary artery was then engaged using hand injections of nonionic contrast material the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views the catheter was then removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and was removed over guidewire next judkins right 4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of guidewire the guidewire was removed the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed using hand injections of nonionic contrast material the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views the catheter was then removed from the ostium of the right coronary artery and then removed the sheath was then flushed because the patient did have high left ventricular end diastolic pressures it was determined that the patient wound need right heart catheterization thus an 18 gauge argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral vein steel guidewire was inserted

875,blood pressure is measurement of the pressure in your arteries during the active and resting phases of each heartbeat here what the numbers mean systolic pressure the first top number in blood pressure reading this is the amount of pressure your heart generates when pumping blood through your arteries to the rest of your body diastolic pressure the second bottom number in blood pressure reading this refers to the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats current guidelines identify normal blood pressure as lower than 120 80 mm hg although you can get an accurate blood pressure reading at any given time blood pressure isn always the same it can vary considerably in short amount of time sometimes from one heartbeat to the next depending on body position breathing rhythm stress level physical condition medications you take what you eat and drink and even time of day blood pressure is usually lowest at night and rises sharply on waking blood pressure how low can you go what considered low blood pressure for you may be normal for someone else most doctors consider chronically low blood pressure too low only if it causes noticeable symptoms some experts define low blood pressure as readings lower than 90 mm hg systolic or 60 mm hg diastolic you need to have only one number in the low range for your blood pressure to be considered lower than normal in other words if your systolic pressure is perfect 115 but your diastolic pressure is 50 you re considered to have lower than normal pressure sudden fall in blood pressure also can be dangerous change of just 20 mm hg drop from 110 systolic to 90 mm hg systolic for example can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive an adequate supply of blood and big plunges especially those caused by uncontrolled bleeding severe infections or allergic reactions can be life threatening athletes and people who exercise regularly tend to have lower blood pressure and slower heart rate than do people who aren as fit so in general do nonsmokers and people who eat healthy diet and maintain normal weight but in some rare instances low blood pressure can be sign of serious even life threatening disorders conditions that can cause low blood pressure some medical conditions can cause low blood pressure these include pregnancy because woman circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy blood pressure is likely to drop this is normal and blood pressure usually returns to your pre pregnancy level after you ve given birth heart problems some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate bradycardia heart valve problems heart attack and heart failure these conditions may cause low blood pressure because they prevent your body from being able to circulate enough blood endocrine problems thyroid conditions such as parathyroid disease adrenal insufficiency addison disease low blood sugar hypoglycemia and in some cases diabetes can trigger low blood pressure dehydration when you become dehydrated your body loses more water than it takes in even mild dehydration can cause weakness dizziness and fatigue fever vomiting severe diarrhea overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can all lead to dehydration far more serious is hypovolemic shock life threatening complication of dehydration it occurs when low blood volume causes sudden drop in blood pressure and reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching your tissues if untreated severe hypovolemic shock can cause death within few minutes or hours blood loss losing lot of blood from major injury or internal bleeding reduces the amount of blood in your body leading to severe drop in blood pressure severe infection septicemia septicemia can happen when an infection in the body enters the bloodstream this condition can lead to life threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis anaphylaxis is severe and potentially life threatening allergic reaction common triggers of anaphylaxis include foods certain medications insect venoms and latex anaphylaxis can cause breathing problems hives itching swollen throat and drop in blood pressure lack of nutrients in your diet lack of the vitamins 12 and folate can cause condition in which your body doesn produce enough red blood cells anemia causing low blood pressure medications that can cause low blood pressure some medications you may take can also cause low blood pressure including diuretics water pills such as furosemide lasix and hydrochlorothiazide microzide oretic alpha blockers such as prazosin minipress and labetalol beta blockers such as atenolol tenormin propranolol inderal innopran xl others and timolol drugs for parkinson disease such as pramipexole mirapex or those containing levodopa certain types of antidepressants tricyclic antidepressants including doxepin silenor imipramine tofranil protriptyline vivactil and trimipramine surmontil sildenafil viagra or tadalafil cialis particularly in combination with the heart medication nitroglycerin types of low blood pressure doctors often break down low blood pressure hypotension into different categories depending on the causes and other factors some types of low blood pressure include low blood pressure on standing up orthostatic or postural hypotension this is sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from sitting position or if you stand up after lying down ordinarily gravity causes blood to pool in your legs whenever you stand your body compensates for this by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessels thereby ensuring that enough blood returns to your brain but in people with orthostatic hypotension this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls leading to symptoms of dizziness lightheadedness blurred vision and even fainting orthostatic hypotension can occur for variety of reasons including dehydration prolonged bed rest pregnancy diabetes heart problems burns excessive heat large varicose veins and certain neurological disorders number of medications also can cause orthostatic hypotension particularly drugs used to treat high blood pressure diuretics beta blockers calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors as well as antidepressants and drugs used to treat parkinson disease and erectile dysfunction orthostatic hypotension is especially common in older adults with as many as 20 percent of those older than age 65 experiencing orthostatic hypotension but orthostatic hypotension can also affect young otherwise healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after working for time in squatting position low blood pressure after eating postprandial hypotension postprandial hypotension is sudden drop in blood pressure after eating it affects mostly older adults just as gravity pulls blood to your feet when you stand large amount of blood flows to your digestive tract after you eat ordinarily your body counteracts this by increasing your heart rate and constricting certain blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure but in some people these mechanisms fail leading to dizziness faintness and falls postprandial hypotension is more likely to affect people with high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system disorders such as parkinson disease lowering the dose of blood pressure drugs and eating small low carbohydrate meals may help reduce symptoms low blood pressure from faulty brain signals neurally mediated hypotension this disorder causes blood pressure to drop after standing for long periods leading to signs and symptoms such as dizziness nausea and fainting neurally mediated hypotension mostly affects young people and it seems to occur because of miscommunication between the heart and the brain when you stand for extended periods your blood pressure falls as blood pools in your legs normally your body then makes adjustments to normalize your blood pressure but in people with neurally mediated hypotension nerves in the heart left ventricle actually signal the brain that blood pressure is too high rather than too low as result the brain lessens the heart rate decreasing blood pressure even further this causes more blood to pool in the legs and less blood to reach the brain leading to lightheadedness and fainting low blood pressure due to nervous system damage multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension also called shy drager syndrome this rare disorder causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system which controls involuntary functions such as blood pressure heart rate breathing and digestion although this condition can be associated with muscle tremors slowed movement problems with coordination and speech and incontinence its main characteristic is severe orthostatic hypotension in combination with very high blood pressure when lying down low blood pressure causes general hypotension low blood pressure without symptoms is not generally cause for concern long term hypotension that does not cause symptoms is rarely serious in fact many athletes have low blood pressure and have decreased risk of developing heart disease hypotension that causes symptoms may be sign of an underlying health condition sometimes hypotension may even indicate serious and or life threatening problem such as widespread infection below are some of the most common causes of hypotension allergic reaction anaphylaxis life threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis often causes sudden and dramatic drop in blood pressure additional symptoms may include itching hives difficulty breathing swelling of the throat and tongue stomach cramps nausea and diarrhea this reaction may occur in response to medications herbs supplements foods such as peanuts bee stings or other severe allergies blood loss sudden hypotension may occur if person loses lot of blood from serious injury internal bleeding or complications during surgery the severity of hypotension depends on how much blood is lost endocrine problems endocrine disorders also called hormonal disorders may cause hypotension endocrine problems occur when the body releases too many or too few hormones which are chemicals that help regulate bodily functions endocrine problems such as an underactive thyroid called hypothyroidism overactive thyroid called hyperthyroidism adrenal insufficiency called addison disease low blood sugar levels and in some cases diabetes may lead to hypotension dehydration dehydration may lead to hypotension even mild dehydration may cause symptoms such as lightheadedness dizziness and weakness severe dehydration may lead to life threatening complication called hypovolemic shock this condition occurs when decreased blood volume in the body causes sudden drop in blood pressure as result the body tissues and organs do not receive enough oxygen if left untreated hypoyolemic shock may be fatal within few minutes to hours heart problems several heart problems including an extremely low heart rate called bradycardia heart valve problems heart attack and heart failure may lead to hypotension these conditions prevent the body from circulating enough blood to tissues and organs medications many drugs can cause low blood pressure including diuretics blood pressure lowering drugs heart medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers drugs used to treat parkinson disease tricyclic antidepressants erectile dysfunction drugs such as viagra narcotics and alcohol other medications prescription and over the counter may lower blood pressure when they are taken in combination with blood pressure lowering drugs nutritional deficiencies people who have low levels of vitamin 12 and folate may develop anemia condition that may cause low blood pressure people who have eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia have an increased risk of developing nutritional deficiencies that can lead to hypotension pregnancy woman blood pressure often decreases during pregnancy this is because the mother circulatory system expands quickly during pregnancy during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy it is common for woman systolic blood pressure to drop five to 10 points and for her diastolic pressure to drop 10 15 points septicemia and septic shock severe infection called septicemia may lead to hypotension septicemia occurs when an infection enters the bloodstream and spreads throughout the body as the heart works extra hard to pump blood throughout the body it starts to weaken and blood pressure drops when blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels the condition is called septic shock ,no

898,with the temperature rising our body needs more fluids and to maintain the temperature and keep the body cool the heart is forced to pump blood at faster rate while most people tolerate these changes without any problem those with damaged or weakened heart are at high risk of heat stroke dehydration arrhythmias angina and heart attack which in some cases might be fatal so to keep your heart healthy during summer here are five tips from our expert dr sanjay kumar hod principal consultant cardiology fortis escorts hospital faridabad you need to keep in the mind 1 stay hydrated according to dr sanjay dehydration is known trigger for atrial fibrillation and stroke as summer causes excess loss of fluid from the body it is important to stay hydrated by drinking fluids such as water coconut water soups and juices people above the age of 50 years fail to recognise that they are thirsty and often become victims of dehydration and heat stroke hence ensure to drink water frequently even if you are not thirsty 2 choose medications wisely people suffering from heart disease and hypertension are often prescribed diuretics also known as water pills however when taken during summer it might worsen dehydration by increasing the urine output even the consumption of antidepressants and antihistamines can also block sweating thereby further worsening the condition if you feel dizzy or light headed check with your doctor immediately regarding reducing the dosage fo the medication during summer 3 limit the consumption of caffeinated or alcoholic beverages it goes without saying that the consumption of alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks during summer might trigger dehydration thereby increasing your risk of heart complications also people who have undergone angioplasty or those with stents and artificial heart valves need to be more cautious as dehydration might cause thickening of the blood which can cause blocking of the stent hence it is wise to load up your intake of water here are 11 heart healthy drinks 4 limit outdoor activities it is always advisable to exercise outdoors but during summer it is important to ease the strain on the heart caused by the summer heat hence limit outdoor activities like brisk walking running or gardening to evenings and not in the morning it is advisable to stay indoors during the morning and afternoon hours when the temperature is the highest if you are planning to workout wear light colored clothes and those made from breathable fabric like cotton you may like to read about 5 exercises that help you cope after heart attack 5 consult your doctor if you suspect anything wrong patients with coronary heart disease may get episodes of angina during summer due to increased pressure on the heart and the heightened demand for oxygen moreover these people are at high risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure hence it is critical for people with heart disease to stay healthy and take necessary precautions when the temperature rises if you suspect any symptoms of heat stroke visit nearest hospital immediately to avoid any causality image source shutterstock article source http www thehealthsite com diseases conditions expert tips to keep your heart healthy in summer b0416 ,no
899,posted mar 14 2016 at 8 27pm nano balls filled with poison wipe out metastatic cancer in mice for most cancer patients it not the original tumor that poses the greatest risk it the metastases that invade the lung liver and other tissues now researchers have come up with an approach that tricks these spinoff tumors into swallowing poison so far the strategy has only been tested in mice where it proved highly effective but the results are promising enough that the researchers are planning to launch clinical trials in cancer patients within year the new work is very innovative stuff says steven libutti geneticist and cancer surgeon at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york city who was not involved in the study the treatment he explains works in three steps to place conventional chemotherapeutic agent near the nucleus or nuclei of metastatic cancer cell where the drug molecules are most lethal it almost like multistage rocket that lifts astronauts off earth sends them to the moon and returns them safely he says at the heart of the new therapy is chemotherapeutic agent called doxorubicin dox the drug has been mainstay of cancer treatment for years as it jams up dna in the cell nucleus and prevents tumor cells from dividing but when it injected into the bloodstream the drug can also kill heart muscle cells and cause heart failure which often forces oncologists to either dial back the dose or discontinue it altogether delivering dox only to tumor cells is therefore highly desirable but it has been major challenge hoping to provide such cell specificity researchers led by mauro ferrari nanomedicine expert as well as president and ceo of the houston methodist research institute in texas have spent years developing porous silicon particles as drug carriers the particles micrometer scale size and disklike shape allows them travel unimpeded through normal blood vessels but when they hit blood vessels around tumors which are typically malformed and leaky the particles fall out of the circulation and pool near the tumor that was step one in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs to their target but just filling such particles with dox doesn do much good ferrari says even if small amount of the drug finds its way inside tumor cells those cells often have membrane proteins that act as tiny pumps to push the drug back outside the cell before it can do any damage silicon particles act as nanoparticle generators inpg that carry stringlike polymers loaded with chemotherapy compound called doxorubicin dox nature biotechnology to get large amounts of dox inside the metastatic tumor cells and then past the protein pumps ferrari and colleagues linked numerous dox molecules to stringlike molecules called polymers they then infused the dox carrying polymers into their silicon microparticles and injected them into mice that had been implanted with human metastatic liver and lung tumors as with the previous studies the researchers found that the silicon particles congregated in and around tumor sites and once there the particles slowly degraded over 2 to 4 weeks as they did so the silicon particles released the dox carrying polymer strands in the watery environment around tumor cells the strands coiled up into tiny balls each just 20 80 nanometers across that size ferrari says is ideal because it the same size as tiny vesicles that are commonly exchanged between neighboring cells as part of their normal chemical communication in this case the dox polymer balls were readily taken up by tumor cells once there large fraction was carried internally away from the dox exporting pumps at cell membrane and toward the nucleus ferrari says at this point his team isn sure exactly why the dox laden balls are ferried toward the nucleus though this is exactly what they wanted not only is the region around the nucleus devoid of dox removing pumps but it typically has more acidic environment than near the cell membrane and ferrari team used this to their advantage as well they designed the chemical links between dox molecules and the polymer to dissolve under acidic conditions this releases the dox at the site where its cell killing potency is highest up to 50 of cancer bearing mice given the treatment showed no signs of metastatic tumors 8 months later the researchers report today in nature biotechnology in humans ferrari says that equivalent to being cancer free for 24 years if this research bears out in humans and we see even fraction of this survival time we are still talking about dramatically extending life for many years ferrari says that essentially providing cure in patient population that is now being told there is none the new treatment isn the first nanomedicine to show promise according to recent nanotechnology working group study published in the lancet more than 50 nanomedicine compounds are now in clinical trials however the new work is promising libutti says because the silicon microparticles tend to target tumors in the liver and lung common destinations of metastatic tumor cells the new work holds out hope for improving the effectiveness of other chemotherapy drugs as well libutti says there no reason to believe you couldn make version of these particles with any chemotherapeutic agent dx idc tnbc 6 09 age 49 stage 1 grade 3 1 5cm 0 5nodes ki

assessment the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress although o2 had been placed elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s he continued to complain of symptoms as noted above he became progressively more rapidly obtunded the patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival and the bipap apparatus was being readied for his use however the patient at this point became unresponsive unable to answer questions and preparations were begun for intubation the bipap apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation it was noted that even with the bipap apparatus in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the bipap mask the patientâ o2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range all preparations for intubation having been undertaken succinylcholine was ordered but was apparently unavailable in the department as the patient was quite obtunded and while the dacuronium was being sought an initial trial of intubation was carried out using straight blade and cupped 7 9 endotracheal tube however the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of dacuronium 10 mg after approximately two minutes another attempt at intubation was successful the cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation the endotracheal tube having been placed atraumatically the patient was initially then nebulated on 100 oxygen and his o2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90 100 range chest ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube the patient was given 1 mg of versed with decrease of his pulse from the 140 180 range to the 120 range with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure because of complaint of chest pain which myself did not hear during the patientâ initial triage elevation trial of tridil was begun as the patientâ pressures held in the slightly elevated range it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute however after administration of the dacuronium and versed the patientâ blood pressure fell somewhat and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98 because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis the patient received one gram of rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation nasogastric and foley were placed and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy dr was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit to be placed on the ventilator there the doctorâ call was transferred to the intensive care unit so he could

926,i was working in cardiac icu last year when took and passed the ccrn used that exact book and typically just did questions over and over on the computer with the program they provided the test is heavily focused on cardiac including swann number interpretation not just svr means this but if the svr is this and you gave this many mg of this type of med what would happen to insert another swann number it even asked me specific mg of an obscure cardiac drug that would prescribe for patient with chf the questions are random so you may get rough test with high number of killer hard questions or you may get blend of reasonable questions took the test twice and noticed significant difference in difficulty between the two tests which is why you hear from some people that the test was easy for them good luck to you drill those questions for couple months until you re scoring probably an 80 or higher without much difficulty take the test don stress if you fail the first time retake it and just keep moving ,no

french arterial sheath was placed selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography the patient had totally occluded right coronary we

then attempted to put 30 12 mm stent across the stenosis but we had very little guide support the guide kept coming out we then switched to an al1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion we finally had to go an al2 guide we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection that guided seated we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis and we did see little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip the surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open but we were able to re cross with sport wire we then re dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support we were able to get 30 23 mm vision stent where the lesion was and post dilated it to 18 atmospheres routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear but we were able to re wire that area and get 25 x12 vision balloon and dilate the area and re establish flow to the small segment we then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put 30 x15 mm vision stent at 18 atmospheres final angiography showed resolution of the dissection we could see little staining extrinsic to the stent no perforation and excellent flow during the intervention we did give bolus and drip of angiomax at the end of the procedure we stopped the angiomax and gave 600 mg of plavix we did right femoral angiogram however the angio seal plug could not take so we used manual pressure and femostop we transported the patient to his room in stable condition angiographic data left main coronary is normal left anterior descending artery has fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60 stenosis of the lad before it bifurcates into diagonal the diagonal does appear to have about 50 osteal stenosis there is lot of plaquing further down the diagonal but good flow the rest of the lad looked good pass the proximal 60 stenosis and after the diagonal branch circumflex artery was nondominant vessel consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel the first obtuse marginal had long 50 narrowing and then the av groove branch was free of any disease some mild collaterals to the right were seen right coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the right coronary just about 0 5 cm after its origin after we got wire across the area of occlusion we could see some thrombosis and 99 stenosis just at the curve following the balloon angioplasty we established good flow down the distal vessel we still had about residual 70 stenosis when we had to go back with the al2 guide we could see little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused little bit of intimal dissection we re dilated and then deployed repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally we never did have the wire that far down so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus after deploying the stent we had total resolution of the original lesion we then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off large pda the posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion we got wire through and dilated this we then came back and put second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in little subintimal pouch but this was excluded by the stent there were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow the distal posterolateral branch did open up although it was little under filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there impression atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary successfully stented to zero residual with repair of small proximal dissection minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60 proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50 diagonal stenosis along with 50 stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch ,yes

957,10 inventions the creators never lived to see by emilios manolidis toptenz 13 april 2016 throughout history the works of inventors engineers polymaths and entrepreneurs have advanced mankind in both small steps and giant leaps forward but not all of those designs came to life while the hearts of their creators were still beating sometimes it was an abrupt death other times it was lack of funding or public interest some inventions were even vague or hastily scrawled designs in the originator notebook but many of them were finally built sometimes hundreds of years after that person died 10 viola organista leonardo da vinci notorious for being cryptic and vague the polymath leonardo da vinci included in his codex atlanticus around 1490 the designs of an organ able of producing string sounds like violin but which operated with keyboard like piano leonardo having the attention span of true genius which is to say none at all never bothered building it however his designs although not extremely detailed gave good idea to future craftsmen about how to go about creating one around 1575 an instrument called geigenwerk was built by the german hans haiden it resembled leonardo original idea but operated on slightly different mechanical principle the most faithful interpretation of da vinci schematics so far is the organ finished in 2012 by slawomir zubrzycki 493 years after its intellectual father passed away truly unique organ it has raised no small amount of musicians eyebrows about how existing musical arrangements can be played with it 9 typewriter henry mill henry mill was an english new river company engineer in 1714 he obtained patent for an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another although vaguely described mill conception has been regarded as first clear proposal of creating what later came to be known as typewriter mill died in 1770 but the potential existence of such machine got the attention of among others people trying to facilitate communication for blind people in 1843 charles thurber constructed machine for this purpose finally in 1873 103 years after mill death the americans christopher sholes and carlos glidden put together what can be recognized today in form and function as typewriter revolutionizing the way people put their thoughts into paper 8 clifton suspension bridge isambard kingdom brunel one of britain most revered figures isambard kingdom brunel is considered the founding father of modern civil engineering he was only 24 years old when in 1830 he was appointed project engineer for constructing bridge above the river avon in bristol after several rejections and conflicts with the committee tasked to approve submitted designs the clifton suspension bridge was not an easy project at the time of construction it had the longest span of any bridge in the world further delays and setbacks left the bridge unfinished at the time of his death being heavy smoker brunel died of stroke in 1859 construction was continued based on brunel designs and the bridge was finally finished in 1864 fitting memorial for the late engineer as well as an impressive landmark in its own right today standing 214 meters long between its two 26 meter high towers and 76 meters above the river its core infrastructure remains unaltered brunel had to push the limits of civil engineering to the point that even modern calculations leave engineers in awe of how perfectly accurate and balanced his designs were 7 lear fan 2100 bill lear in the late 1970 bill lear inventor and founder of the lear jet corporation had an idea for unique aircraft type made almost entirely of composite materials like carbon graphite it would have the same durability at about half the weight of typical aluminum alloys its twin engines and rear mounted propeller would make it about as fast as other jets at that time the us federal aviation administration having reservations about gearbox and aerodynamics performance refused to give the project the green light for production lear didn live long enough to perfect his dream dying of leukemia in 1978 his desire to have the jet completed was so great that as dying wish he told his wife moya to finish it with the help of british government funding the prototype made its maiden flight in 1981 never having entered commercial production three finished models are now in display at the museum of flight in seattle washington at the frontiers of flight museum in dallas texas and in the back lot of faa facility in oklahoma city 6 demologos steam warship robert fulton the first warship ever to be propelled by steam engine the united states navy designs for the uss demologos began in 1814 robert fulton renowned engineer and inventor imagined ship unlike any other heavily armed and armored and its twin hulls had paddlewheel between them the engine was on one hull while the boilers were on the other floating fortress well suited for local defense it weighed 2 475 displacement tons and was 48 meters long in 1815 before the ship was completed fulton jumped in the icy waters of the hudson river to save friend who fell in struck by pneumonia which quickly developed into pulmonary tuberculosis he died the same year shortly after the demologos was fully finished and the navy renamed it the fulton to honor the inventor the warship never saw any real action due to the end of the war of 1812 and it was destroyed in 1829 due to gunpowder explosion 5 omnia dir airship enrico forlanini there was time where airships were considered good idea for passenger transport after the great war italian inventor and aeronautical pioneer enrico forlanini sought to put into air traffic new airship type with unprecedented maneuverability in 1930 he presented the design of omnia dir 56 meter long dirigible with 4 000 cubic meters capacity what made it special aside from forlanini already established expertise was the addition of jet propulsion to the classic engine and propeller scheme high pressure air jets installed at the ship bow and stern offered the ship unbelievable for the time maneuvering speed both on ground and in the air forlanini died in 1930 before the ship was completed and aside for test flight it never entered mass production its innovative design however became point of reference and helped study and develop auxiliary thrust technology in aircraft 4 automatic computing engine ace alan turing by the time world war ii had ended building computer was entirely possible anyone with half million dollars and really big room could have one what was missing from the greater picture was general purpose computer existing models were very limited in what they could do they could very specific tasks and nothing more it was no wonder that the mathematical genius alan turing was summoned to build the very first electronic stored program general purpose digital computer in 1946 he presented his design to the uk national physical laboratory work began in 1947 ace operated nothing like modern systems do as its logic resembled more biological neuron functions rather than the boolean logic all modern computers are based on turing stayed few months on the project leaving npl technicians baffled about how to carry on the pilot model finished in 1950 was pretty fast for the time though not exactly what turing had envisioned turing died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 and the first full scale ace model was completed in 1957 3 pendulum clock galileo galilei when he was not being bullied by the inquisition galileo observed and recorded physical phenomena one of them was the back and forth motion of suspended weight the physics behind pendulum motion is no small deal its study paved the way for an entire branch of physics namely the harmonic oscillators model that has helped represent and explain problems ranging from planetary motion to quantum mechanics galileo was the first to notice that contrary to common intuition the period of swing of pendulum is independent of its swinging arc in 1641 galileo was 77 years old and blind he had fully described the inner works of pendulum clock and his son vincenzo tried to make one without success galileo died in early 1642 leaving lot of finely formulated physical theories to future scientists it was in 1656 14 years later that the dutch astronomer and physicist christiaan huygens built the world first pendulum clock 2 hi power pistol john browning during the 1920s the french military requested handgun that should be compact have an ammo capacity of at least 10 rounds could be easily assembled and disassembled and could be produced at low cost john browning legend among gun designers and salesmen filed the patent in 1923 thumb safety and external hammer were also incorporated in the design browning died in 1926 of heart failure and the design was handed to and perfected by the belgian dieudonne saive finally introducing the gun in 1935 although not adopted by the french army at the time the hi power is one of the most recognizable widely used and most heavily sought firearms by collectors many conflicts in history had both sides using it due to its reliability and power for its size it is still manufactured today in japan 1 the difference engine charles babbage during the victorian era all mathematical tables were calculated manually tedious process with many errors slipping in charles babbage an english mathematician and philosopher envisioned machine able to perform all those calculations automatically thus eliminating errors conceived as digital device it used toothed wheels to represent and carry over digits from 0 9 it was not only suited for solving complex mathematical problems but it also had temporary data storage as well as the ability of printing the results onto soft metal funded with 1 500 by the british government babbage hired joseph clement skilled engineer and began working on the engine by 1833 clement refused to work further due to payment disputes and the government ceased funding the project after having spent more than 17 000 babbage died in 1871 having lived his last years in bitterness for not seeing his work complete in 1991 120 years later the london science museum finished

967,studies are increasingly hailing the potential health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption particularly when it comes to the heart and lifespan but new research suggests many of these studies are flawed and that such benefits may be largely overestimated the researchers say we should be skeptical of studies reporting the health benefits of moderate drinking lead researcher tim stockwell phd of the centre for addictions research at the university of victoria canada and colleagues reached their conclusion by analyzing 87 studies that assessed the effects of moderate drinking on longevity they recently published their findings in the journal of studies on alcohol and drugs according to the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa over the past month around 24 6 of adults report engaging in binge drinking and around 6 8 report engaging in heavy drinking such drinking habits can increase the risk of alcohol use disorders which affect around 16 6 million adults and 697 000 adolescents in the us on the other hand numerous studies have suggested that in moderation alcohol may be good for us recent study reported by medical news today for example suggested moderate drinking defined in the study as three to five alcoholic beverages week may lower the risk of heart attack and heart failure however the new research from stockwell and colleagues suggests the results of such studies should not be taken at face value after finding that many of them are subject to biases that when accounted for eliminate the reported health benefits of moderate drinking there are many reasons to be skeptical from analyzing 87 studies that looked at the effects of alcohol consumption on death from all causes the team identified number of flaws in the way the studies were designed one major issue they found was how the studies defined abstainers people who do not drink alcohol the researchers explain that many of the studies compared moderate drinkers which they define as individuals who consume up to two alcoholic beverages daily with current abstainers but these abstainers may include individuals of poor health who have stopped drinking fundamental question is who are these moderate drinkers being compared against says stockwell in their analysis the researchers found that only 13 of the studies they assessed avoided biases in the abstainer group and these studies demonstrated no mortality benefits with moderate drinking furthermore when the researchers accounted for this bias and other flaws they identified related to study design they found that moderate drinkers no longer showed any mortality benefits additionally the researchers found that it was occasional drinkers defined as individuals who consume less than one alcoholic beverage week who had the longest lifespan and the team says it is unlikely that alcohol is the reason for this those people would be getting biologically insignificant dose of alcohol notes stockwell the team points out that the research did not investigate how specific types of alcohol such as red wine largely hailed for its health benefits when consumed in moderation was associated with longevity but stockwell says it is doubtful any health benefits would be down to the alcohol itself overall the team believes their results suggest studies hailing the health benefits of moderate drinking should be viewed with caution stockwell says there a general idea out there that alcohol is good for us because that what you hear reported all the time but there are many reasons to be skeptical ,no

977,reposted from dr mercola http articles mercola com sites articles archive 2016 02 08 salt intake heart failure aspx x_cid 20160208_nonlead1_salt intake heart failure_facebookdoc by dr mercola close to 6 million americans have heart failure while more than 870 000 cases are diagnosed each year if you have heart failure it means your heart isn pumping as well as it should be and as result your body is probably not getting enough oxygen in other words you have weak heart once simple activities like walking or carrying groceries may become difficult and you may also experience fatigue shortness of breath fluid build up and coughing 1 because heart failure is associated with fluid build up low salt diet is typically recommended excess sodium may cause your body to retain water and so the conventional thinking goes may worsen the fluid build up associated with heart failure this dietary dogma is touted as fact but in reality you may want to think twice about slashing your salt intake if you have heart failure as new research has linked it with an increased risk of death cutting down salt intake might worsen health of heart failure patients researchers from rush university medical center in chicago followed more than 800 heart failure patients for an average of three years both their health status and salt intake were analyzed 2 it turned out that those following low sodium diet were 85 percent more likely to die or require hospitalization for heart disease compared to those who didn restrict their salt intake 3 among those restricting their sodium intake 42 percent died or were hospitalized for heart problems during the study compared to 26 percent of those with no salt restrictions the researchers concluded in symptomatic patients with chronic hf heart failure sodium restriction may have detrimental impact on outcome 4 it possible that restricting salt could backfire by altering person fluid volumes lead researcher dr rami doukky told medical xpress 5 the idea is sodium restriction leads to contraction of the fluid volume in the body and that turns on certain hormones which try to retain fluids in the body and may potentially accelerate the heart failure process heart benefits of salt restriction increasingly questioned the heart benefits of restricting salt intake have been questioned for some time in 2011 systematic review of data involving 6 500 people also found evidence was lacking to recommend salt restriction 6 among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure salt restriction was not significantly associated with overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality among those with congestive heart failure meanwhile salt restriction was associated with increased mortality risk an update to the review published in 2014 also found there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effects of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure 7 yet another meta analysis found that people with heart failure who limited their sodium intake had 160 percent higher risk of death than those who did not 8 some studies have shown modest benefit to salt restriction among some people with high blood pressure but the evidence does not extend to the rest of the population so what really going on for starters there a huge difference between natural salt and the processed salt added to processed foods and salt shakers in most homes and restaurants the former is essential for good health whereas the latter is best avoided altogether sally fallon morell president of the weston price foundation stated 9 study from 1991 indicates that people need about one and one half teaspoons of salt per day anything less triggers cascade of hormones to recuperate sodium from the waste stream hormones that make people vulnerable to heart disease and kidney problems this is proven biochemistry too little salt may be dangerous the s food and drug administration fda and the food safety inspection service fsis recommend limiting your daily sodium intake to less than 2 300 milligrams mg they advise further reduction to 1 500 mg just over one half teaspoon for people who are age 51 and older african american or who have hypertension diabetes or chronic kidney disease this encompasses about half of the s population however there are very real risks from eating too little salt and population wide recommendations to restrict salt intake to very low levels could in fact increase rates of wide range of diseases for instance in one study low salt diet led to an increase in insulin resistance which is risk factor for type 2 diabetes and the change occurred in just seven days 10 research published in jama also found that consuming less than 3 000 mg of sodium per day may increase your risk of dying from heart disease 11 low sodium diet is even linked to increases in ldl cholesterol and triglycerides 12 and an increased risk of death for diabetics another population that often advised to restrict their sodium intake 13 there also hyponatremia in which your body has too little sodium causing fluid levels to rise and your cells to swell hyponatremia is most common in older adults and athletes whose sodium levels may become depleted by excessive sweating and drinking too much water this swelling can cause number of health problems from mild to severe at its worst hyponatremia can be life threatening leading to brain swelling coma and death but mild to moderate hyponatremia has more subtle effects that you or your health care provider may not even connect with sodium deficiency problem including nausea vomiting and changes in appetite headache confusion hallucinations loss of energy fatigue urinary incontinence nervousness restlessness and irritability and other mood changes muscle weakness spasms or cramps seizures unconsciousness coma your sodium potassium ratio another factor that can have significant impact on whether salt will harm or help your health is the ratio between the salt and potassium in your diet your body needs potassium to maintain proper ph levels in your body fluids and it also plays an integral role in regulating your blood pressure it possible that potassium deficiency may be more responsible for hypertension which is risk factor for heart disease than excess sodium imbalance in your sodium potassium ratio can lead to hypertension and the easiest way to achieve this imbalance is by consuming diet of processed foods which are notoriously low in potassium while high in sodium processed foods are also loaded with fructose which is clearly associated with increased hypertension risk as well as virtually all chronic diseases this may also explain why high sodium diets appear to affect some people but not others according to 2011 federal study into sodium and potassium intake those at greatest risk of cardiovascular disease were those who got combination of too much sodium along with too little potassium 14 according to dr elena kuklina one of the lead authors of the study potassium may neutralize the heart damaging effects of salt tellingly those who ate lot of salt and very little potassium were more than twice as likely to die from heart attack as those who ate about equal amounts of both nutrients while potassium is found in many foods commonly consumed in the s including fruits vegetables dairy products salmon sardines and nuts only 2 percent of s adults get the recommended daily amount of 4 700 mg 15 the easiest way to achieve an imbalance in your sodium to potassium ratio is by consuming diet of processed foods which are notoriously low in potassium while high in processed salt according to the fda 77 percent of americans sodium intake comes from processed and restaurant foods when you reduce processed foods in your diet you ll automatically reduce your intake of processed salt as well how to improve your sodium potassium ratio if you eat lot of processed foods and not many vegetables there a good chance your sodium to potassium ratio is unbalanced if you re not sure try free app like my fitness pal which allows you to enter the foods you eat and then calculates the ratio automatically it generally recommended that you consume five times more potassium than sodium but most americans get two times more sodium than potassium if your ratio is out of balance ditch all processed foods which are very high in processed salt and low in potassium and other essential nutrients eat diet of whole unprocessed foods ideally organically and locally grown to ensure optimal nutrient content this type of diet will naturally provide much larger amounts of potassium in relation to sodium when using added salt use natural salt believe himalayan salt may be ideal as it contains lower sodium and higher potassium levels compared to other salts16it can be difficult to get enough potassium from diet but the best way to do so is to increase the amount of vegetables you consume green vegetable juicing is an excellent way to ensure you re getting enough nutrients for optimal health including about 300 to 400 mg of potassium per cup some additional rich sources of potassium are lima beans 955 mg cup winter squash 896 mg cup cooked spinach 839 mg cup avocado 500 mg per medium other potassium rich fruits and vegetables include fruits papayas prunes cantaloupe and bananas but be careful of bananas as they are high in sugar and have half the potassium of an equivalent amount of green vegetables it is myth that you are getting loads of potassium from bananas the potassium is twice as high in green vegetables vegetables broccoli brussels sprouts avocados asparagus pumpkin swiss chard and beet greens top tips to prevent heart failure and other heart problems there are many strategies that can protect your heart no matter what your age please don wait until you experience heart attack symptoms or heart failure to take action because by then it may be too late do so now in order to prevent any long lasting damage eat unprocessed saturated animal fats and ignore the media as you will benefit from these fats many may also benefit from increasing the healthy fat in their diet to 50 to 85 percent of daily calories avoid sugars including processed fructose and grains if you are insulin and leptin resistant it doesn matter if they are conventional or organic as high sugar high grain diet promotes insulin and leptin resistance which is primary driver of heart disease minimize your intake of salt from processed foods and instead use natural himalayan salt to flavor your real food exercise regularly people who engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise week had 33 percent lower risk of heart failure than inactive people 17 use combination of high intensity interval training strength training stretching and core work avoid excess sitting aim for three hours day or less of sitting and try to take 10 000 steps day in addition to your exercise program regularly walk barefoot to ground with the earth when you do free electrons are

they have been linked to memory loss and problems in thinking scientists have discovered treatments for colds and flu hay fever allergy and heartburn tablets containing anti cholinergic drugs had the effect for one month after treatment study found effects associated with taking the drugs included having slower brain processing times and smaller brains overall well known treatments including the heartburn medicine zantac night nurse liquid containing promethazine and the sleeping tablet nytol containing diphenhydramine are included among drugs that may result in the effects the research said over the counter treatments for cold flu heartburn and sleeping tablets were found to block the chemical acetylcholine which is involved in the transmission of electrical impulses between nerve cells the drugs block the chemical acetylcholine which is involved in the transmission of electrical impulses between nerve cells the treatments are prescribed for wide range of conditions including parkinson disease overactive bladder chronic obstructive pulmonary disease nausea and vomiting sleeping problems high blood pressure depression and psychosis but the authors warn use of ac anti cholinergic medication among older adults should likely be discouraged if alternative therapies are available previous studies have linked the drugs with cognitive impairment increased risk of dementia and falls however the new study by indiana university school of medicine is the first to explore their impact on brain metabolism and atrophy through brain scans dr shannon risacher the university assistant professor of radiology and imaging sciences said these findings provide us with much better understanding of how this class of drugs may act upon the brain in ways that might raise the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia given all the research evidence physicians might want to consider alternatives to anticholinergic medications if available when working with their older patients the impact of these drugs have been know about for over decade with 2013 study finding drugs with strong anticholinergic effect cause cognitive problems when taken continuously for as few as 60 days drugs with weaker effect could cause impairment within 90 days many over the counter medicines have been linked to slower brain processing times and smaller brains the new study involved 451 participants 60 of whom were taking at least one medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity the participants were drawn from national alzheimer research project the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative and the indiana memory and ageing study to identify possible physical and physiological changes that could be associated with the reported effects researchers assessed the results of memory and other cognitive tests positron emission tests pet measuring brain metabolism and magnetic resonance imaging mri scans for brain structure patients taking anticholinergic drugs performed worse than older adults not taking the drugs on short term memory and some tests of executive function which cover range of activities such as verbal reasoning planning and problem solving anticholinergic drug users also showed lower levels of glucose metabolism biomarker for brain activity in both the overall brain and in the hippocampus region of the brain associated with memory and which has been identified as affected early by alzheimer disease the researchers also found significant links between brain structure revealed by the mri scans and anticholinergic drug use with the participants using anticholinergic drugs having reduced brain volume and larger ventricles the cavities inside the brain professor risacher added these findings might give us clues to the biological basis for the cognitive problems associated with anticholinergic drugs but additional studies are needed if we are to truly understand the mechanisms involved the study was published in the journal jama neurology john smith chief executive of the proprietary association of great britain which represents makers of over the counter medicines said the medicines linked to the study were not intended to be used on daily basis anticholinergic medicines include some over the counter allergy and cold and flu products however they are intended for short term relief of symptoms only he said it is important to note that the jama study only involved people with mean age of 73 in what the researchers conceded was small sample the study followed people who took medicines that were low medium or high in anticholinergic activity and concluded that the use of medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity should be discouraged in older adults if alternative therapies are available however due to the study limitations the researchers propose that further and more advanced studies are needed anticholinergic medicines include some over the counter allergy and cold and flu products but these are intended for short term relief of symptoms and not for continuous use as in the research if anyone has any concerns about their medicine we would advise them to talk to their pharmacist there is range of different allergy cold and flu products on the market which contain different ingredients many of which were not considered in this study and pharmacist will be able to recommend suitable product all over the counter medicines in the uk have been approved by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra and are rigorously assessed for safety and efficacy once on

992,reuters health over the last 40 years heart disease rates have dropped in the s overall but the changes varied widely by region with the highest rates of the disease shifting from the northeast to the south researchers say heart disease refers to several conditions including coronary artery disease which can cause heart attack despite the decline in deaths over time heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the s killing more than 600 000 people per year according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the consistent progression southward over the past few decades suggests that the pattern is not random and could be attributed to geographic differences in prevention and treatment opportunities said lead author michele casper of the cdc division for heart disease and stroke prevention in atlanta georgia identifying those counties and regions with the greatest burden of mortality is necessary first step to target appropriate resources that will ultimately reduce death rates casper told reuters health by email the researchers used data on heart disease deaths among people age 35 and over in the s collected in two year intervals between 1973 and 2010 from more than 3 000 counties of the 48 contiguous states every county saw decline in heart disease deaths the average decline across the s was 61 percent but some counties only saw decline of 9 percent while others cut heart disease deaths by 83 percent at the beginning of the study heart disease deaths were most common in the northeast through appalachia and into the midwest coastal north carolina south carolina and georgia also had high rates most counties with the lowest death rates were located in the west with some low rate counties also scattered in alabama florida and mississippi by 2010 most high rate counties were still in the eastern half of the country but in the south rather than in the north with some parts of new england becoming pockets with lower death rates declines were slowest in counties in alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas oklahoma and parts of texas the authors reported in paper scheduled for publication in circulation since the 1970s national attention on the dangers of cigarette smoking and uncontrolled high blood pressure has led to significant decline in deaths from coronary heart disease and heart attack but heart disease includes other conditions which have not decreased as much said dr donald barr of stanford university school of medicine in california who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study comparable data for heart failure which is different process not due to clogging of blood vessels but due to the heart wearing out as result of diabetes obesity and underlying high blood pressure has not been coming down as fast barr told reuters health by phone heart failure is projected to increase over the next couple of decades while coronary heart disease is expected to decline he said heart failure disproportionately affects low income americans and african americans he said these at risk populations are found in somewhat higher proportion in those southeastern states combining heart failure and coronary heart disease under the global term heart disease combines good news with not so good news barr said there were still meaningful declines in heart disease deaths in the south casper noted heart disease related deaths are largely preventable and with targeted public health efforts it possible to alleviate much of the heavy burden of this disease and close the geographic gap in declining heart disease death rates casper said with collaboration government agencies medical care organizations community groups businesses and other organizations can provide more local opportunities for physical activity as well as access to smoke free spaces affordable healthy foods quality healthcare and social and economic well being source http bit ly 1xihahi circulation released march 21 2016 ,no

1000,greetings sarah they may seem overwhelming but the big key to understanding contraindications is understanding diseases the body and how massage affects it while massage has multitude of benefits for the body it can also be extremely taxing on one especially if the body is already dealing with major health issues in these cases it is appropriate to check with their doctor as they are more familiar with their condition we are in an odd situation as being quasi medical health care workers we know and work with the body and yet are not doctors and cannot diagnose or treat conditions try to err on the side of caution as you definately do not want to cause any harm to your client now on to your specific questions medical edema the question here is what is causing the edema edema or swelling tissues from lymphatic fluid might indicate several dangerous conditions including heart failure or deep vein thrombosis dvt blood clot in vein usually in leg can suddenly shift and lodge in the lungs called pulmonary imbolism to the brain causing stroke or to the heart causing heart attack all of these need immediate medical attention nervous psychotic conditions massage can be okay if the person is in stable condition an unstable person might need to be under medical supervision not on your table massage is actually great adjunct to medical treatment for depression anxiety and other conditions there are few considerations for some of the medications people might be taking trapped or pinched nerves the danger here is further injury to the nerve or the problem that caused it in the first place we cannot know where in problem is nor what might aggravate it and really massage would be more appropriate after the problem has been healed to help the tension and stiffness that the nerve caused inflamed nerve similar to the pinched or trapped nerve massage brings more fluid to the area and this might aggravate the nerve ice might be better alternative with doctor supervision with massage afterwards bell palsy bell palsy is partial facial paralasys caused by an inflamed facial nerve while it does go away with little to no ill effects the cause needs to be determined by doctor usually it is idiopathic basically we have no idea what causes it it could also be uncomfortable for the person to get massaged since they are not in normal state asthma massage is fine for people with asthma unless they are haveing severe attack or if it might trigger an attack some massage techniques like stripping the intercostals and crac stretches actually helped me reduce the need for my inhaler epilepsy again if well treated massage should be fine the doctor would be the one to determine if massage is suitable for the person there is always chance of the client having seizure and can be both frightening and dangerous recent operations how recent is recent as said massage can be very taxing on healing body especially if recovering from large operation there is always the chance of infection for both of you especially if the incision is still healing you could also irritate the site by working too close to it and generally if the scab has fallen off and the cut is no longer open massage should be fine as long as care is taken around the incision site but again the doctor should be contacted especially if it was for something major like heart problems or cancer treatment there might be other underlying health problems that need to be taken into consideration all of their medical history should come out in the intake interview have turned people away and told them that needed their doctor permission before worked on them one woman who had surgery one week before to remove cancerous lymph nodes called her doctor after told her that could only work with the dr word sure enough he did not advise massage instead gave her half hour hand and foot massage since she was so desperate for healing and touch so there are alternatives out there for people who cannot get massage like reiki japanese hands on energy work knowing something like that can also make an nice adjunct to medical treatment hope this helps sarah please let me know if can do anything else to help sincerely christopher hall,no

1025,interesting things are emerging recently about an axis between p53 which turns out to be much more than tumor suppressing pathway and very involved in metabolism as well and various disorders like parkinsons and diabetes http www ncbi nlm pubmed 23917356 http www pnas org 8 3116 full pdf and most interestingly http www mdpi com 67 17 1 122 pdf although p53 has well documented role as tumor suppressor recent detailed studies have identified broader functions for p53 that are independent of its effects in tumorigenesis p53 had been shown to regulate the transcription of several genes involved in redox and glucose metabolism and autophagy 5 6 it also possesses an extranuclear function in which cytosolic p53 inhibits the process of autophagy by poorly known mechanism 7 we have previously demonstrated the contribution of p53 to mitochondrial integrity p53 is required for mitochondrial aerobic respiration through the expression of sco2 8 conversely cytosolic p53 has been shown to disturb the clearance of damaged mitochondria by an inhibitory interaction with parkin 9 other recent studies have also revealed that p53 has distinct cellular function according to its cellular concentration and distribution 10 thus p53 mediated inhibition of mitophagy modulates cardiac dysfunction raising the possibility that therapeutic activation of mitophagy by inhibiting cytosolic p53 may ameliorate heart failure and symptoms of cardiac ageing and some insight about yet another way metformin might work by decreasing p53 expression inducing mitophagy cytosolic p53 inhibited mitophagy by disturbing the mitochondrial translocation of parkin as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation however metformin decreased er stress and p53 expression resulting in induction of parkin mediated mitophagy furthermore pifithrin specific inhibitor of p53 increased mitochondrial incorporation into autophagosomes taken together these results indicate that metformin treatment facilitates parkin mediated mitophagy rather than mitochondrial spheroid formation by decreasing the inhibitory interaction with cytosolic p53 and increasing degradation of mitofusins increased p53 is seen in senescent insulin resistant adipocytes http www ncbi nlm pubmed 19718037 inhibition of p53 activity in adipose tissue markedly ameliorated these senescence like changes decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improved insulin resistance in mice with type 2 diabetes like disease conversely upregulation of p53 in adipose tissue caused an inflammatory response that led to insulin resistance adipose tissue from individuals with diabetes also showed senescence like features our results show previously unappreciated role of adipose tissue p53 expression in the regulation of insulin resistance and suggest that cellular aging signals in adipose tissue could be new target for the treatment of diabetes pages 996 967 so this may be either the way or another way metformin works in reducing hyperglycemia basically what this might say is that p53 is sometimes inhibiting mitophagy and bad mitochondria cannot be removed p53 has put the cell into senescent state and it not doing you any good either all the coq10 buckyballs and mitoq won beat the process of getting rid of the bad mitochondria to begin with it interesting that p53 amyloids aggregates also exist but this is possibly unrelated http www ncbi nlm pubmed 22715097 other recent studies have also revealed that p53 has distinct cellular function according to its cellular concentration and distribution 10 this probably does have implications for parkinsons ,no

patient is 65 year old gentleman with history of exertional dyspnea and cramping like chest pain thallium scan has been negative he is undergoing angiography to determine if his symptoms are due to coronary artery disease narrative the right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and the area of the right coronary artery anesthetized with 2 lidocaine constant sedation was obtained using versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg received additional versed and fentanyl during the procedure please refer to the nurses notes for dosages and timing the right femoral artery was entered and 4 french sheath was placed advancement of the guidewire demonstrated some obstruction at the level of abdominal aorta via the right judkins catheter the guidewire was easily infiltrated to the thoracic aorta and over aortic arch the right judkins catheter was advanced to the origin of the right coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed this revealed very high grade lesion at the proximal right coronary artery this catheter was exchanged for left 4 judkins catheter which was advanced to the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed the patient was found to have the above mentioned high grade lesion in the right coronary artery and coronary intervention was performed 6 french sheath and right judkins guide was placed the patient was started on bivalarudin bmw wire was easily placed across the lesion and into the distal right coronary artery 3 0 15 mm voyager balloon was placed and deployed at 10 atmospheres the intermediate result was improved with timi 3 flow to the terminus of the vessel following this 3 0 18 mm xience stent was placed across the lesion and deployed at 17 atmospheres this revealed excellent result however at the very distal of the stent there was an area of haziness but no definite dissection this was stented with 3 0 8 mm xience stent deployed again at 17 atmospheres final angiograms revealed excellent result with timi 3 flow at the terminus of the right coronary artery and approximately 10 residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing the guiding catheter was withdrawn over wire and pigtail was placed this was advanced to the abdominal aorta at the area of obstruction and small injection of contrast was given demonstrating that there was small aneurysm versus small retrograde dissection in that area with some dye hang up after injection the catheter was removed the bivalarudin was stopped at the termination of procedure small injection of contrast given through arterial sheath and angio seal was placed without incident it should also be noted that an 8 french sheath was placed in the right femoral vein this was placed initially as the patient was going to have right heart catheterization as well because of the dyspnea total contrast media 205 ml total fluoroscopy time was 7 5 minutes ray dose 2666 milligray hemodynamics rhythm was sinus throughout the procedure aortic pressure was 170 81 mmhg the right coronary artery is dominant vessel this vessel gives rise to conus branch and two small rv free wall branches and pda and small left ventricular branch it should be noted that there was competitive flow in the posterior left ventricular branch and that the distal right coronary artery fills via left sided collaterals in the proximal right coronary artery there is large ulcerative plaque followed immediately by severe stenosis that is subtotal in severity after intervention there is timi 3 flow to the terminus of the right coronary with better fill into the distal right coronary artery and loss of competitive flow there was approximately 10 residual stenosis at the worst part of the previous stenosis the left main is without disease and trifurcates into moderate sized ramus intermedius the lad and the circumflex the ramus intermedius is free of disease the lad terminates at the lv apex and has elongated area of mild stenosis at its mid segment this measures 25 to 30 at its worst point the circumflex is large caliber vessel there is proximal 15 to 20 stenosis and an area of ectasia in the proximal circumflex distally this circumflex gives rise to large bifurcating marginal artery and beyond that point the circumflex is small vessel within the av groove the aortogram demonstrates eccentric aneurysm formation this may represent small retrograde dissection as well there was some dye hang up in the wall impression 1 successful stenting of subtotal stenosis of the proximal coronary artery 2 non obstructive coronary

1036,people of sometime ago lived well at their years natural oils and herbal remedies for migraine victims they obtain as aged as hundred years or even longer adam died at age 930 noah 950 abraham hundred seventy five isaac one hundred and eighty with methuselah being the oldest character in the bible to die in 969 several sectors think that longer life span can be related to factors such as meals environment and lifestyle long time ago most meals were not prepared and had been consumed in the natural state naturally individuals are healthier because of the absence of chemicals and preservatives which can cause lot of the current day health problems prevalent today the environment was also free from harmful contaminants brought about by industrialization and life styles then were simple enough to not cause too much stress and anxiety but today contemporary world is definitely far from the olden days where life is just like breeze of fresh air and no matter just how much people try to bring back the ways we are able to only obtain so far people can go on diet plan of natural foods proper lifestyle of fitness without the vices such as smoking cigarettes drinking alcohol and the like but what about the environment this really is different story people can take part in tree planting tasks in campaigns against pollution recycling solutions etc it may minimize the harmful associated with worldwide natural pollution or maybe the green house effect but as the world continues to evolve and develop improvement will still destroy the ecosystem the atmosphere as well as its natural resources the exhaustion of the ozone layer is certainly recognized as threat to human into the the environment global warming caused by the carbon dioxide exhausts from vehicles are also the reason behind wide range of respiratory illnesses that has caused directly and indirectly the deaths of thousands although there are very few people who still live up to more than hundred years aged such as cuban benito martinez whom died in 126 upon october 2006 life expectancy has dramatically fallen down to eighty on the typical the fast paced way of living brought about by advancements in technology has produced physical psychological and mental conditions such as cerebrovascular accident depression stress and anxiety disorders grown up bedwetting forums find out how others are coping latest studies however show that americans are living longer and healthier nowadays reason for this are the technical advancement in medicines such as the new medical screening assessments which can often detect illnesses and possibly serious health problems in their early treatable phases some of these assessments include blood pressure check heart problems screening bloodstream sugar test stress check blood pressure pertains to the arterial pressure that takes bloodstream away from the cardiovascular blood pressure tends to rise as people age however hypertension also known as hypertonie is one of the risk factors pertaining to heart stroke heart episodes heart failing arterial aneurysms and chronic renal failure it kills the cardiovascular brain eye and kidneys don let hypertonie sneak up on you get your stress checked by your doctor at least one time year cholesterol screening cholesterol is waxy fat like substance the body uses to produce many hormones vitamin as well as the bile stomach acids that assist to digest body fat but it requires only small amount of cholesterol in the blood to fulfill these needs too much cholesterol in the bloodstream or high cholesterol amounts are risk factor to get heart disease and stroke because of this it is important to measure the bad cholesterol levels at least once every five years and more frequently if you are at higher risk blood sugar test blood sugars test decides how well your body can process sugar or blood sugar it also diagnoses diabetes which could destroy your health leading to heart disease kidney failure and blindness when left untreated diabetes is potentially life threatening condition which can be managed in the event that detected in the early stage get bloodstream sugar test at least once every 3 years acquiring these lab tests and physical check ups usually do not guarantee longer life but it will surely help improve one health to visit your health care providers in regular visit it is tips to practice healthy and energetic lifestyle to prevent acquiring serious medical conditions which can shorten one life expectancy ,no

1042,metformin containing drugs drug safety communication revised warnings for certain patients with reduced kidney function audience pharmacy nephrology internal medicine patient issue fda is requiring labeling changes regarding the recommendations for metformin containing medicines for diabetes to expand metformin use in certain patients with reduced kidney function the current labeling strongly recommends against use of metformin in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally fda was asked to review numerous medical studies regarding the safety of metformin use in patients with mild to moderate impairment in kidney function and to change the measure of kidney function in the metformin drug labeling that is used to determine whether patient can receive metformin fda concluded from the review of studies published in the medical literature that metformin can be used safely in patients with mild impairment in kidney function and in some patients with moderate impairment in kidney function fda is requiring changes to the metformin labeling to reflect this new information and provide specific recommendations on the drug use in patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment fda is also requiring manufacturers to revise the labeling to recommend that the measure of kidney function used to determine whether patient can receive metformin be changed from one based on single laboratory parameter blood creatinine concentration to one that provides better estimate of renal function e glomerular filtration rate estimating equation egfr this is because in addition to blood creatinine concentration the glomerular filtration rate takes into account additional parameters that are important such as the patient age gender race and or weight see the fda drug safety communication for additional information including data summary and list of metformin containing drugs background metformin containing medicines are available by prescription only and are used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes when untreated type 2 diabetes can lead to serious problems including blindness nerve and kidney damage and heart disease metformin containing medicines are available as single ingredient products and also in combination with other drugs used to treat diabetes the current drug labeling strongly recommends against metformin use in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally because use of metformin in these patients can increase the risk of developing serious and potentially deadly condition called lactic acidosis in which too much lactic acid builds up in the blood recommendation healthcare professionals should follow the latest recommendations when prescribing metformin containing medicines to patients with impaired kidney function patients should talk to their health care professionals if they have any questions or concerns about taking metformin the labeling recommendations on how and when kidney function is measured in patients receiving metformin will include the following information before starting metformin obtain the patient egfr metformin is contraindicated in patients with an egfr below 30 ml minute 1 73 m2 starting metformin in patients with an egfr between 30 45 ml minute 1 73 m2 is not recommended obtain an egfr at least annually in all patients taking metformin in patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment such as the elderly renal function should be assessed more frequently in patients taking metformin whose egfr later falls below 45 ml minute 1 73 m2 assess the benefits and risks of continuing treatment discontinue metformin if the patient egfr later falls below 30 ml minute 1 73 m2 discontinue metformin at the time of or before an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an egfr between 30 and 60 ml minute 1 73 m2 in patients with history of liver disease alcoholism or heart failure or in patients who will be administered intra arterial iodinated contrast re evaluate egfr 48 hours after the imaging procedure restart metformin if renal function is stable healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged

1058,must watch possible first case of cte diagnosed in the living 06 19 cte is football bogeyman researchers aren sure exactly what makes some players susceptible to the disease and others not factors such as genetics and age of first impact may play role but what is clear for many researchers is that it occurs because of repeated head trauma that results in buildup of an abnormal protein called tau the tangles of tau can overtake parts of the brain that control for memory mood and aggression the symptoms are similar to alzheimer but begin much earlier there are four stages of the disease and the most severe cases can result in suicidal thoughts 5 things to know about cte fred jr remembers hearing the headlines of other players dave duerson junior seau and mike webster all seemed to have parallels to his father life that when you start to realize ok yeah the rage the forgetfulness the identity crisis he said gavin even talked to his father about suicide and his dad brushed it off m not going to do that nah nah just joking around gavin recalled it a conversation no son should have with their father all gavin could say was hope you wouldn i love you just know that if you hear me hear that first cte has no cure it can only be diagnosed with an autopsy tia mcneill had no idea at the time what her husband future looked like but she knew that when he passed she would have omalu evaluate his brain we wanted to know she said diagnosing the living in 2012 omalu approached the mcneills with new technology that he had helped developed and is invested in called taumark it uses radioactive tracer called fddnp to bind to tau proteins in the brain the tau proteins can then be seen on positron emission tomography or pet scan omalu explained to cnn that this technology could only be licensed to corporations and that his motive behind it is not profit but research when omalu and his team examined the scan there were angry red splotches all over fred mcneill brain his wife wasn surprised living brain scans of five former nfl players including fred mcneill critics say the test is too early it only been used on 14 former football players but more importantly they say it isn precise enough it binds to tau as well as amyloid proteins signature for alzheimer omalu said it not just what the marker is highlighting but where the highlights are tau has distinctive pattern in cte and omalu said his test is tracing the tau in the same places he found it in autopsies meanwhile mcneill dementia continued to worsen his outbursts became more extreme ultimately the family moved him into an assisted living facility it was more for his safety tia mcneill said different kind of care fred mcneill found home at the silverado beverly memory care community in los angeles few blocks from gavin office and minutes away from his wife home silverado is one of the nfl two preferred providers of memory care it was the best care they could find but tia mcneill said it was never perfect fit there were 70 80 90 year olds at the facility and fred mcneill was just in his early 60s still relatively fit he wanted to walk throw around footballs he loved music and karaoke former nfl players need different kind of care tia mcneill contends sylvia mackey wife of hall of famer john mackey agrees she wrote letter to then nfl commissioner paul

gets calls from nfl wives all the time about what to look for and what they can do to help their husbands she recalled when her husband entered nursing home surrounded by folks in wheelchairs who could barely get around she remembers him pushing the other residents in their wheelchairs she said it wasn just the age difference but the pure physical difference of the former football players they need larger beds and larger equipment as the disease progresses and they become less mobile they need lift chairs things they need to help them move around and the staff can shoulder that physically themselves they need equipment to help mackey said fred mcneill was linebacker for the minnesota vikings she also said the former athletes still identify as players brothers of certain bond tia

1063,what you have described is and don want to lessen your position but very similar to lot of us on here it took me 6 months to be diagnosed was on the puffers nebuliser and even had one doctor tell me was hyperventilating even had chest xrays and no one saw my enlarged heart it was only after day of testing ct scan and then the echo that was diagnosed was actually very excited to finally get diagnosis otherwise in my view it was off to the psychiatrist this all happened in 1999 17 years ago and am still going at the time there was genuine life expectancy of 5 years for cardiomyopathy but luckily was diagnosed the year that cardiverol was introduced to the world and for chf patients my ef was 18 like you had an excellent result from my angiogram pristine arteries didn get my icd until 2006 got biventricular pacer with the icd but was decompensating at the time and it was what needed to keep me going to me it saved my life know it is big shock to get as you say this brick in your chest was 45 on diagnosis but had 10 year old daughter so there were lot of issues that faced also 10 years on my brick has saved my life 5 times by shocking me out of cardiac arrest it has kept my heart going through lot of other illnesses not related to heart disease it even saved me when anyone else without an icd would have died from septicemia have been through cancer gall bladder disease and septicemia mitral valve replacement as result of the septicemia and more recently appendicitis all in the past 4 years through all of these illnesses have felt assured that will not die as result of sudden cardiac arrest and as my arteries are still good felt that was protected through all these issues my heart function is not that good at the moment my ef has dropped and am back in chf again but honestly the last thing worry about is the icd it has proved that it is life saver to me mind you the first few years had the device it really didn need to do much but in the last 4 years would be dead if it wasn there to protect me look at all the other people out there in the community who could drop dead from sca and know am protected just look at the young athletes that drop dead whilst playing or running the tragedy of this is that if they were protected with an icd they would have been able to get up and continue on with their lives so yes it is very big procedure to come to terms with it also is sign that you are not physically well that you have heart disease you are faced with your own mortality and the realization that your world has changed but once you go through the grieving process regarding these issues you will come out the other side with certainty that you are protected by your little in your chest so glad you have come on here for support this is brilliant group you will not get any of the normal platitudes from us we speak the truth and from experience nothing like peer on peer support as am sure you realize as psychologist ,yes

1071,posted by christian goodman new study reveals devastating fact if you ve been following dietary guidelines for high blood pressure from the us food and drug administration or american heart association cutting down on one ingredient according to their guidelines something almost nobody questions will lead to stroke heart attack and death even if you succeed in lowering your blood pressure many organizations including the us food and drug administration and the american heart association have warned that high sodium intake causes high blood pressure accordingly the official dietary guidelines set by the s department of health and human services and the s department of agriculture state that people should eat no more than 2 300 milligrams or 2 3 grams of sodium per day and that they should keep it well below this if possible many researchers have now started questioning this recommendation the largest recent study of this kind was recently published in the new england journal of medicine the scientists collected the information of more than 100 000 people daily sodium consumption throughout the world by looking at the amount of sodium excreted in their urine they also collected those same people blood pressure readings their findings 1 large majority of those people who consumed 5 99 or more grams of sodium per day had high blood pressure from this they concluded that such massive sodium intake clearly caused high blood pressure 2 as only moderate number of people with daily sodium intake between 3 and 5 99 grams suffered from high blood pressure they concluded that the relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure was weaker for this group but that there was still relationship 3 for the low intake group below three grams per day they found no relationship between sodium and blood pressure instead of falling as the popular theory would suggest these people blood pressure scores were completely random this shows that low sodium diets do not lower blood pressure this was however not the study most interesting finding after following the participants for an average of 3 7 years they discovered this 1 4 3 of those who consumed less than three grams of daily sodium either died developed heart failure or suffered heart attack or stroke 2 3 1 with an intake between three and six grams experienced these outcomes 3 3 2 with an intake between six and seven grams did 4 3 3 with an intake above seven grams did that is those with the lowest sodium consumption consistent with governmental guidelines were the most likely to die and suffer harmful cardiovascular events perhaps this should not be surprising sodium is an essential mineral sodium is critical for all of this maintains normal blood pressure and blood volume generates nerve impulses for normal nerve function contributes to muscle contractions helps to balance electrolytes plays part in the metabolic processes that supply you with energy ensures that your body maintains good balance between retaining necessary water and dumping surplus water another interesting finding was that people with high sodium intake were less likely to have high blood pressure if they also consumed plenty of potassium repeated studies have in fact proven that loading up on food based potassium is more important than cutting out salt so stock up on dark leafy greens white beans salmon squash avocados and bananas and then you can add your healthy himalayan pink salt to your food if you like regardless of how much salt you consume if your blood pressure is high you must take actions to lower it 22,no

2014 and 5 growth in total carticel and epicel net product revenues in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2014 achieved 60 and 24 growth in epicel net product revenues for 2015 and the fourth quarter respectively versus the same periods in 2014 and entered into 10 million credit facility and 5 million term loan agreement with silicon valley bank 2015 was an extremely productive year during which we completed our corporate transformation into sustainable and growing commercial enterprise substantially increased revenues and gross margins and made significant progress on our clinical and regulatory objectives that we expect will drive current and long term growth for the company said nick colangelo president and ceo of vericel we believe that we have positioned the company as one of the leading cell therapy and regenerative medicine companies in the industry financial highlights total revenues for the fourth quarter and year ended 2015 were generated primarily from net sales of carticel implants and surgical kits and epicel which were acquired on may 30 2014 as part of the acquisition of sanofi cell therapy and regenerative medicine business total net revenues for the quarter ended december 31 2015 were approximately 15 4 million and included approximately 11 3 million of net sales of carticel implants and surgical kits and approximately 4 1 million of net sales of epicel total carticel and epicel net product revenues in the fourth quarter increased approximately 5 over the same period in 2014 total net revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 were approximately 51 2 million including approximately 35 2 million of net sales of carticel implants and surgical kits and approximately 15 2 million of net sales of epicel total carticel and epicel net product revenues for 2015 increased approximately 14 over pro forma carticel and epicel net product revenues for 2014 total revenues for the quarter and year ended december 31 2015 included approximately 0 1 million and 0 7 million of sales respectively from our marrow donation business which ceased operations in december 2015 gross profit for the quarter and year ended december 31 2015 was 8 2 million or 53 of net product sales and 24 7 million or 48 of net product sales respectively compared to 8 0 million or 54 of net product sales and 11 5 million or 40 of net product sales for the quarter and year ended december 31 2014 respectively research and development expenses for the quarter and year ended december 31 2015 were 7 4 million and 18 9 million respectively versus 5 8 million and 21 3 million for the same periods in 2014 the increase in research and development expenses in the fourth quarter is primarily due to additional research development and regulatory costs incurred for the biologics license application bla for maci and humanitarian device exemption hde supplement submitted in december 2015 to revise the labeled indications for use of epicel which included 2 2 million in regulatory consulting expenses and prescription drug user fee act pdufa filing fee of 2 4 million paid in the fourth quarter of 2015 the decrease in full year research and development expenses is primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with the ixcell dcm clinical trial which completed enrollment in january 2015 and other clinical trial expenses and 3 2 million payment in 2014 to the former shareholders of verigen pursuant to settlement agreement that eliminated all future milestone payments related to the development and commercialization of maci in the united states selling general and administrative expenses for the quarter and year ended december 31 2015 were 5 7 million and 22 5 million respectively compared to 4 5 million and 13 8 million for the same periods in 2014 the increase in sg expenses is primarily due to vericel vcel being commercial business for all of 2015 compared to only seven months in 2014 as well as an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with carticel and epicel and strategic planning activities for maci loss from operations for the quarter and year ended december

operating loss of 0 4 million in the fourth quarter material non cash items impacting the operating loss for the quarter and year included 0 6 million and 2 7 million respectively of stock based compensation expense and 0 4 million and 1 6 million respectively in depreciation and amortization expense other income expense for the quarter and year ended december 31 2015 was less than 0 1 million and 0 3 million respectively compared to less than 0 1 million and 3 6 million for the same periods in 2014 the change in other income for the quarter is primarily due to decrease in the fair value of warrants in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 the decrease in other income for the full year 2015 is primarily due to bargain purchase gain of 3 5 million recognized in 2014 and decrease in the fair value of warrants in 2015 compared to 2014 vericel vcel reported net loss for the quarter and year ended december 31 2015 of 4 9 million or 0 28 per share

graft to obtuse margin branch saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery presented with recurrent difficulties with breathing this was felt to be related largely to chronic obstructive lung disease she had dynamic wave changes in precordial leads cardiac enzymes were indeterminate she was evaluated by dr and given her previous history and multiple risk factors it was elected to proceed with cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography risks of the procedure including risks of conscious sedation death cerebrovascular accident dye reaction need for emergency surgery vascular access injury and or infection and risks of cath based interventions were discussed in detail the patient understood and agreed to proceed description of the procedure the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory under versed and fentanyl sedation the right groin was sterilely prepped and draped local anesthesia was obtained with 2 xylocaine the right femoral artery was entered using modified seldinger technique and 4 french introducer sheath placed in that vessel through the indwelling femoral arterial sheath jl4 4 french catheter was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta appropriately aspirated and flushed ascending aortic root pressures obtained this catheter was utilized in an attempt to cannulate the left coronary ostium this catheter was too small was exchanged for jl5 4 french catheter which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta the cath appropriately aspirated and flushed and advanced to left coronary ostium and multiple views of left coronary artery obtained this catheter was then exchanged for 4 french right coronary catheter which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta the catheter appropriately aspirated and flushed the catheter was advanced in the right coronary artery multiple views of that vessel were obtained the catheter was then sequentially advanced to the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch and left internal mammary artery left anterior descending coronary artery and multiple views of those vessels were obtained this catheter was then exchanged for 4 french pigtail catheter which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta the catheter was appropriately aspirated and flushed and advanced to left ventricle baseline left ventricular pressures obtained following this left ventriculography was performed in 30 degree rao projection using 30 ml of contrast injected over 3 seconds post left ventriculography pressures were then obtained as was pullback pressure across the aortic valve videotapes were then reviewed it was elected to terminate the procedure at that point in time the vascular sheath was removed and manual compression carried out excellent hemostasis was obtained the patient tolerated the procedure without complication results of procedure 1 hemodynamics left ventricular end diastolic filling pressure was 24 there was no gradient across the aortic valve 2 left ventriculography left ventriculography demonstrated well preserved left ventricular systolic function mild inferobasilar hypokinesis was noted no significant mitral regurgitation noted ejection fraction was estimated at 60 3 coronary arteriography left main coronary the left main coronary was patent left anterior descending coronary artery left anterior descending coronary was occluded shortly after very small first septal perforator was given circumflex coronary artery circumflex coronary artery was occluded at its origin right coronary artery right coronary artery was occluded in its mid portion 4 saphenous vein graft angiography saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch the saphenous vein graft to diagonal branch was widely patent at its origin and insertion sites excellent flow was noted in the diagonal system with some retrograde flow there was retrograde flow as well in the left anterior descending system saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal system saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal system was widely patent at its origin and insertion sites there was no graft disease noted excellent flow was noted in the bifurcating marginal system saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery saphenous vein graft to right coronary was widely patent with no graft disease origin and insertion sites were free of disease distal flow in the graft to the posterior descending was normal 5 left internal mammary artery angiography left internal mammary artery angiography demonstrated widely patent left internal mammary at its origin and insertion sites there was no focal disease noted inserted into the mid to distal lad which was small caliber vessel

1115,history of present illness the patient is 68 year old woman whom have been following who has had angina in any case today she called me because she had recurrent left arm pain after her stent three days ago and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when spoke to her advised her to call 911 which she did while waiting for 911 she was attended to by physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain by the time she presented here she is currently pain free and is feeling well past cardiac history the patient has been having arm pain for several months she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me which was equivocal but then she had nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia had originally advised her for heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy so we put her on beta blocker however her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain so she presented to the emergency room on 08 16 08 she ended up having cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80 mid lad lesion circumflex normal and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right as well as right to right to that area the decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the lad stenosis to the rca vessel she underwent that with drug eluting stents on 08 16 08 with believe three or four total placed and was discharged on 08 17 08 she had some left arm discomfort on 08 18 08 but this was mild yesterday she felt very fatigued but no arm pain and today she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin this is her usual angina she is being admitted with unstable angina post stent past medical history longstanding hypertension cad as above hyperlipidemia and overactive bladder medications 1 detrol la 2 mg once day 2 prilosec for gerd 20 mg once day 3 glucosamine 500 400 mg once day for arthritis 4 multivitamin o daily 5 nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her 6 toprol xl 25 mg once day which started although she had been bradycardic but she seems to be tolerating 7 aspirin 325 mg once day 8 plavix 75 mg once day 9 diovan 160 mg once day 10 claritin 10 mg once day for allergic rhinitis 11 norvasc 5 mg once day 12 lipitor 5 mg once day 13 evista 60 mg once day allergies allergies to medications are none she denies any shrimp or sea food allergy family history her father died of an mi in his 50s and brother had his first mi and bypass surgery at 54 social history she does not smoke cigarettes abuse alcohol no use of illicit drugs she is divorced and lives alone and is retired laboratory technician from cornell diagnostic laboratory review of systems she denies history of stroke cancer vomiting up blood coughing up blood bright red blood per rectum bleeding stomach ulcers renal calculi cholelithiasis asthma emphysema pneumonia tuberculosis home oxygen use or sleep apnea although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05 08 no morning headaches or fatigue no psychiatric diagnosis no psoriasis no lupus remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above physical examination general she is

blood cell count 8 2 hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08 15 08 and platelet count 257 000 impression and plan the patient is 68 year old woman with exertional angina characterized with arm pain who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery in any case given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy we will continue her beta blocker and cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already aspirin plavix valsartan lipitor and norvasc am going to add imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before and we will rule out mi although there is little suspicion suppose it is possible that she has non cardiac arm pain but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in pacemaker so we can maximize beta blocker use for anti anginal effect my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention which was severely stenotic and she does have normal lv function she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis claritin for allergies and detrol la for urinary incontinence total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes all this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement the patient desires full resuscitation status ,yes

1125,by debra redman lmt nctmb margarette is the picture of health so mini health crisis came as surprise in the same week her divorce was to be final she was scheduled as an outpatient for an ablation type of heart surgery on wednesday and replacement breast implant surgery on friday the post surgical recovery would have most people flat on their backs for more than just few days imagine my surprise when she answered her door for manual lymph drainage massage the day after the heart surgery the immune system does not react well to being over stressed margarette was experiencing very stressful time in her life she had swelling in her right leg from the malfunctioning valve in her heart the collapsed breast implant left her chest feeling heavy as medical massage therapist suggested she relieve some of the discomfort with medical massage modality called manual lymph drainage mld this specialized technique is designed to stimulate the immune system and help the lymphatic system achieve healing in the body margarette received mld both before and immediately after her surgeries pre operative mld cleans the area so that there is little bleeding creating an environment that decreases pain levels and the chance for infection this primed her lymph system to start moving toxins out of her body before the surgeries the effects of mld last up to 72 hours depending upon the duration of the massage the result is that it slows the amount of bleeding during surgery and causes the body to begin detoxifying the chemicals from the anesthesia and other medications immediately the post operative session kept the process going diminishing pain levels to the point where margarette didn need any medication she recovered so quickly she was back at work by the following wednesday missing only five workdays mld uses very gentle precise strokes to promote the release of fluid build up in the body called edema any interruption in lymph circulation can impair the functioning of the body immune system its ability to repair damaged tissue and cause chemical imbalance in the body if left untreated the swelling could potentially lead to more serious medical condition called lymphedema edema is condition defined as swelling that occurs when interstitial fluid builds up in the muscles of the body lymphedema is build up of fluid in the lymph system unlike edema lymphedema can become chronic condition that has consequences for the whole body swelling pain numbness sensation of pressure increased susceptibility to infection loss of mobility and impaired wound healing are all result of chronic lymphedema chronic swelling has four levels of manifestation micro edema mild or pitting edema non pitting edema and severe hardening the first two can be reversed and usually completely alleviated with mld the last two cannot be reversed but mld may help relieve the symptoms some reasons why the lymph system will respond with edema include illness lack of exercise injury e sports surgery disease and being on an airplane flight mld helps both acute and chronic conditions types of conditions that mld cannot help include kidney disease nephritis leaking blood vessels varicose veins third degree burns congestive heart failure untreated high blood pressure obstructions in the circulation system thrombosis or clots and active cancers most people learn about the effects of lymphedema when they experience cancer based on client feedback very little information is disseminated to non cancer patients about how to take care of the swelling they experience after sports injury accident or surgical procedure not very many people are told about the benefits of mld prior to surgical events or the impact on healing after surgery have discussed mld

1128,thanks for your question on healthcare magic can understand your concern yes these symptoms are worrisome in your case your heart is working only 30 this can cause heart failure and retention of fluid in the body this excess fluid accumulate in the lungs and cause pulmonary edema this is the reason for your breathlessness and other chest symptoms so along with other drugs you should also start diuretics and cardiac inotropic drugs diuretics will remove excess fluid while inotropic drugs will increase force of contraction and improve heart function cause if this in your case is unknown consult cardiologist and discuss all these hope have solved your query will be happy to help you further wish you good health thanks ,no
1129,i don particularly like the other answers so ll chime in for background m 4th year medical student sitting in cardiologists office ll elaborate on what chewylewisandthenews said first off is to realize how conduction in the heart works it is very complex system but will attempt to simplify an impulse is generated in the sa node by special cells that automatically polarize and depolarize at certain rate this signal is sent from the sa node atria av node purkinje fibers ventricles epinephrine and norepinephrine can modulate this automaticity by binding b1 receptors in addition the av node between the atria and ventricles has adrenergic receptors which will allow the time that the is needed to conduct an impulse through the av node to be decreased faster repolarization with these two basic principles we can move forward the way that bbs work is by competing with adrenaline for spot on the receptor when adrenaline is bound hr increases when less adrenaline is bound hr decreases if you are strictly talking about cardiac receptors then if you expose the patient to the bb their heart rate will decrease because it is blocking the adrenaline from binding the receptors but keep in mind there are thousands and thousands of receptors and not all are going to be blocked only portion so the others can be bound by adrenaline so net effect the heart rate will decrease when you exercise your body releases more adrenaline think fight or flight and thus the proportion of bb to adrenaline decreases so more adrenaline is binding to the receptor this will cause your hr to be elevated from baseline however your hr could potentially be higher o the bb depending on how high it is for this reason your body is not able to appropriately deal with your muscles increased o2 demand and you will get decreased exercise tolerance very common side effect can get lactic acidosis due to increased anaerobic activity in addition to increased soreness post exercise there are more than one type of beta blocker some are cardioselective g atenolol and these exhibit the majority of the action on the b1 receptor then there are other types that are non selective propanolol b2 selective albuterol that are used for all sorts of diseases when giving beta blocker for heart failure after heart attack or atrial fibrillation the reasoning is not always the same for atrial fibrillation for example the electrical impulses that are being sent from the atria to the ventricles are being generated in an abnormal pattern somewhere in the atria and conducted through the av node to the ventricles the cardioselective bbs slow the conduction of the impulse through the av node allowing the atria to essentially send more blood into the ventricles prior to it being pumped into the aorta m not sure if by sit up you mean standing from sitting or doing sit ups but either way bbs can cause you to lose consciousness if you are elderly and try to stand too quickly due to decreased perfusion of the brain orthostatic hypotension and is common reason to take select patients off of bbs know this is long response but hope it helped ,no

ventricular lv leads offering additional electrode spacing options and one new lead shape the additional spacing combinations are aimed to more effectively target the individual cardiac anatomies of patients who need support from cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers crt and defibrillators crt the expanded selection of quadripolar pacing leads reinforces st jude medical leadership in quadripolar pacing and heart failure treatment options heart and blood vessel anatomy vary from patient to patient so having multiple sizes and spacing options with the quartet quadripolar lead helps me to treat all of my patients in need of cardiac resynchronization therapy we are now able to place the quadripolar lead in the best possible location for that patient capturing more cardiac tissue to give heart failure patients the best opportunity to respond said dr sami pakarinen cardiologist from helsinki university central hospital in finland studies have shown that crt can improve the quality of life for many patients with heart failure crt resynchronizes the beating of the heart lower chambers ventricles which often beat out of sync in heart failure patients the addition of multipoint pacing technology enables physicians to program single quartet lv lead to pace multiple sites on the left side of the heart giving the clinician more choices to improve patient response to therapy and reducing the likelihood of costly and invasive lead revision through second intervention procedure these lead choices allow physicians to identify what lead spacing option will work best for each patient so they can individualize care said philip adamson d medical director and vice president of medical affairs at st jude medical the expanded selection of quadripolar pacing leads

americans and about 26 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body when this happens blood pressure eventually rises leading to shortness of breath fatigue swelling and other symptoms cardiac resynchronization therapy is treatment option for symptomatic heart failure quadripolar pacing technology from st jude medical st jude medical introduced the industry first quadripolar pacing system featuring four pacing electrodes the quadripolar pacing system offers physicians the ability to effectively and efficiently manage the ever changing needs of patients with heart failure the system integrates multiple pacing configurations and tailoredtherapy features that enable physicians to optimize the system at implant and follow up as well as better manage common pacing complications without having to surgically reposition the lead the quartet lead design allows the physician to implant the lead in the most stable position without making trade offs in electrical performance this includes pacing closer to the base of the left ventricle which studies associate with better patient outcomes and which may be more difficult with traditional bipolar leads the quadripolar pacing electrodes also provide physicians more options to optimize crt performance such as pacing around scar tissue in the heart and avoiding the most common pacing complications the more crt prospective randomized clinical trial of more than 1 500 patients demonstrated 40 percent relative risk reduction of lead related

allowing any procedures to test for reflux disease as further complications could arise if undetected and the varicose veins could return when was the last time you paid any attention to your veins maybe when you gave blood and yet they are an integral part of the vascular system that keeps us alive day in and day out whether we think about it or not veins are the blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart and into the lungs to be replenished with the oxygen and nutrients the body needs to function and stay healthy for the blood to get to the heart from the legs it must travel upwards against gravity it does this with the help of the veins and the muscle that surrounds them when we stand and walk the muscles constrict squeezing the veins and pushing the blood toward the heart through system of valves when we sit or at rest the muscles relax and valves within the veins close to prevent blood from flowing back into the legs and feet about 90 percent of our blood returns to the heart by way of the deep veins veins that lie deep within the body the other two types of veins are superficial and connecting superficial veins are the ones you can see through your skin they carry blood from tissue closer to the surface of your skin to the deep veins where the blood flows to the heart connecting veins carry blood from the superficial veins to the deep veins unfortunately our veins can also develop problems the following chart lists and describes the most common vein problems that can develop in the legs some are more serious than others but all are worth discussing with your doctor type of vein problem description thrombosis blood clot in the vein blood clots can block blood flow or break free and travel through the blood stream to the heart and lungs pulmonary embolism thrombophlebitis swelling caused by blood clot in the vein it can occur in the superficial or deep veins deep vein thrombosis dvt with dvt blood clots form in the large veins deep within the legs pelvis and sometimes in the arms dvt strikes about 1 in 20 people over the course of lifetime pulmonary embolism pe when blood clot breaks free from deep vein and makes its way into an artery in the lung it is called pulmonary embolism pe pe is life threatening condition that can cause heart failure it is important to call 911 if you have trouble breathing or if you are coughing up blood post thrombotic syndrome also known as post phlebitic syndrome and venous stress disorder in this condition the symptoms of pain heaviness in the leg or foot cramps itching tingling bluish or brownish flaky skin sores and varicose veins caused by dvt continue after treatment either because the blood clot is still there or the blood clot caused other damage to the vein chronic venous insufficiency cvi venous reflux high blood pressure in the vein venous hypertension varicose veins spider veins cvi is damage or weakness in the vein wall or vein valve that allows blood to flow backl down into the vein venous reflux the backflow of blood accumulates in the veins and causes inflammation phlebitis and more clotting clotting can block or slow blood flow through the vein raising the blood pressure and possibly causing more damage varicose and spider veins are caused by the accumulation of the blood from venous reflux phlebitis swelling in the deep or superficial veins is called phlebitis venous sores when pressure in the veins continues for long time it can break down healthy tissue which causes ulcers or sores congenital vascular malformation includes birthmarks this is catch all term for the very few people less than 1 percent who are born with veins that are defective in some way for example the veins may not have valves this category also includes birthmarks that are mass of veins

1155,hi there are no specific remedies to improve breathlessness after an acute heart attack what we should do is look for the cause of this problem and propose targeted treatment first it is important to explain what it means myocardial infarction myocardial infarction also known as heart attack is when piece of the heart is destroyed once destroyed that area will no longer contraction function and the rest of the heart will have to work more to address the lack of that piece when this piece destroyed is bigger causes larger contraction deficits including severe heart dysfunction and can cause death of patients second when there is loss of contractile function of the heart loses some of its ability to pump blood forward and liquids become accumulated in various parts of the body especially the lungs causing pulmonary edema this fluid accumulation in the lungs is responsible for the sensation of breathlessness then believe the heart attack you had may have destroyed large area in your heart leading to condition known as heart failure and there are several treatments for this problem incuindo cardiopulmonary rehabilitation medications and visits by multidisciplinary team suggest you contact your cardiologist for further information and determine which therapies are needed to solve the problem hope have answered your question if you have any further questions will be happy to help you wish you good health ,no
1156,in 1942 when the fate of nationalist socialist germany was being decided in the eastern front after unternehmen barabarossa went wrong as the coming winter took by surprise wehrmacht who had not planned for winter war in the vast expanses of the soviet union meeting of high ranking members of influential germans and germans loyal to the national socialist movement took place in germany to make plans for after the war in essence rebuild was being planned when das dritte reich was still very much intact adolf hitler had predicted that after the fall of germany the allies would confront its present ally the soviet union led them to believe that what actually happened after the war was going to happen general george patton was highly criticised for working with tens of thousands of former members of the national socialist german regime and his explanation was very straightforward and could be translated as they ran the country and they are the ones who know how to ran the country this is why the new germany was actually built by national socialist germans some heads would roll to give the idea that the allies kind of justice was being done but in essence very little was done because they needed national socialist germans to prepare for what he foresaw as the next battle george patton went as far as saying that the us might have fought against the wrong enemy how many former members of the nationalist socialist germany regime were actually captured in latin america none the one member of the regime that was captured was captured by jewish agent no one else was touched by the so called allies justice system ss officers wehrmacht officers and other influential figures prospered not just in latin america where josef mengele was married under his real name in uruguay and later migrated where he died of heart failure at brazilian resort the truth is the us needed national socialist germans and this is why high ranking figures of the regime were employed by the us government and by the new authorities in germany proper the man that invented the v1 and the v2 wernher von braun became the head of the us space programme that took men to the moon commander heinz guderian that led the attack against france in 1940 was employed to rebuild the german armed forces across latin america former german military man played fundamental role during the world war two and and after world war two things went as far as rewriting the history of former members of the national socialist regime so that it would be acceptable to employ them in 1946 at an important meeting in europe there were things points to be discussed 1 protecting members of the national socialist movement from persecution 2 capital investment to fund the national socialist movement and 3 posting of loyal members of the nationalist socialist movement in position of influence in germany and outside germany what we call european union today was very much part of the plan and is the one thing that would allow germany to play decisive role in europe despite the fact that there are now 28 countries in the european union germany is the one that has the last word in every fundamental decision how is the european union run the executive organ of the european union called european commission is made up with appointed non elected members and it the european commission that has lead role that supersedes the european parliament very easy tool to push measures across the entire eu with little opposition and this complemented by judiciary whose decisions take precedence over decisions made by any other authority ,no

1164,diastolic failure is defined as increased end diastolic pressure normal end diastolic volume with preserved ej defining feature of systolic failure so key principle think here is that this is caused from decrease in compliance of the lv unlike systolic failure which often leads to increased compliance fluid overload this can be caused from lv thickening from aortic stenosis hypertension aging whatever so diastolic function is determined by the relative end diastolic volume in relation to end diastolic pressure and is independent of systolic function by the lv so with less compliance you are trying to get the same amount in to maintain output so pressure then has to increase this makes it more difficult to get blood into the left ventricle so pressure increases in the left atrium to be able to drive the blood into the left ventricle and this pressure is transmitted back to the lungs and you get pulmonary hypertension edema so unlike systolic dysfunction where end systolic volume is increasing and you are getting volume overload leading to fluid back up into the lungs here you are getting the pressure gradient not fluid backing up into the lungs again by definition ej fraction has to be normal otherwise that is systolic failure it kinda weird cause in reality they often occur together so that is why the stem specified isolated the fact that they often are mixed actually makes it tough to precisely dx define for trials as for lvedv reducing that is assuming no compensatory response the heart will do all it can to maintain co so the atria here will work harder to get that same volume in even if it means higher pressure it seems like it would be failing due to the fluid backup but in this case it is pressure back up the pressure is higher so the atria need to be at higher pressure to get the fluid in this pressure goes to the lungs since there is no valve between the mitral and pulmonary vasculature and that increased pressure pushed more fluid out into the interstitium hydrostatic pressure so the decompositions different one the pump is failing and fluid is backing up behind it systolic the other the pump is working really hard at higher pressure because the ventricle is less complaint and that increased pressure is transmitted through the system and gets to the point where it pushes fluids out into the lungs diastolic hope that helps sent from my iphone using sdn mobile app,no

accumulation in many case it is result of cirrhosis according to the study by the harvard medical school patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension often have abnormal extracellular fluid volume regulation resulting in accumulation of fluid as ascites oedema or pleural effusion these complications carry poor prognosis with nearly half of the patients with ascites dying in the ensuing 2 3

to ruptured blood to spill into the pleural space according to the study by the medical centre alkmaar haemothorax is problem commonly encountered in medical practice and is most frequently related to open or closed chest trauma or to invasive procedures of the chest 3 there is report of two cases where seemingly insignificant low energy trauma precipitated massive haemothoraces in elderly patients

1186,we do still provide care we never deny anyone regardless of whether they can pay the problem is that the care gets so bogged down for example if patient comes into the ed with heart failure exacerbation it often because they didn take medication called lasix this is entirely preventable but because this patient with preventable problem is taking up an ed bed that means we can treat someone else who may need to be treated this doesn sound like that big of deal until you take into account all of the little things that have to happen before this patient with preventable problem is admitted from the ed to the inpatient unit to free up that ed bed for another patient have to see the patient have 10 other patients also have to take care of have to interview the patient do physical exam and draw blood to see what going on the blood takes about 1 1 5 hours from the time that it was drawn to when get the results in the meantime start treatment and call the internal medicine team to admit the patient it takes the internal medicine team between 30 45 minutes to come see the patient and put in orders to admit the patient to the inpatient unit then have to wait for the admissions nurse to find an inpatient bed for this patient to go to another physician in administration then reviews my notes and checks to see if the patient meets criteria to be admitted to the inpatient unit about 4 hours after the patient is first put in an ed bed they re finally moved up to the inpatient unit all of this was because the patient did not take one medication ,no

1189,a daily dose of natural vitamin known as vitamin d3 improves heart function in people with chronic heart failure research by the university of leeds has found dr klaus witte from leeds teaching hospitals nhs trust led the study known as vindicate he said this is significant breakthrough for patients it is the first evidence that vitamin d3 can improve heart function of people with heart muscle weakness known as heart failure these findings could make significant difference to the care of heart failure patients vitamin d3 can be boosted by exposure to sunlight but heart failure patients are often deficient in it even during the summer because older people make less vitamin d3 in response to sunlight than younger people the study authors said vitamin d3 production in the skin is also reduced by sunscreen the study which was funded by the medical research council involved more than 160 patients from leeds who were already being treated for their heart failure using proven treatments including beta blockers ace inhibitors and pacemakers participants were asked to take vitamin d3 or dummy placebo tablet for one year those patients who took vitamin d3 experienced an improvement in heart function which was not seen in those who took placebo changes in heart function were measured by cardiac ultrasound heart specialists measure heart function by taking an ultrasound scan of the heart known as an echocardiogram and measuring how much blood pumps from the heart with each heartbeat known as ejection fraction the ejection fraction of healthy person is usually between 60 and 70 in heart failure patients the ejection fraction is often significantly impaired in the patients enrolled into the vindicate study the average ejection fraction was 26 in the 80 patients who took vitamin d3 the heart pumping function improved from 26 to 34 in the others who took placebo there was no change in cardiac function this means that for some heart disease patients taking vitamin d3 regularly may lessen the need for them to be fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd device which detects dangerous irregular heart rhythms and can shock the heart to restore normal rhythm icds are expensive and involve an operation said dr witte if we can avoid an icd implant in just few patients then that is boost to patients and the nhs as whole one key aspect of this study is that the researchers avoided using calcium based supplement as calcium can cause further problems for heart failure patients heart failure affects about 900 000 people in the uk and more than 23 million worldwide the condition can affect people of all ages but it is more common in older people more than half of all people globally with heart failure are over the age of 75 this feed and its contents are the property of the huffington post and use is subject to our terms it may be used for personal consumption but may not be distributed on website ,no

inadequately controlled acute pain is associated with the development of chronic pain optimal pain relief can be achieved by pharmacological and non pharmacological measures mindful of individual variation of response to pain and the need to have multimodal approach finally decide if pain is for round the clock pain relief or prn breakthrough summary of pharmacological analgesics 1 opiate analgesics 2 nsaids including aspirin 3 paracetamol 4 analgesic adjuvants local anesthetic regional block 5 anticonvulsants for post procedural neuropathic pain 6 ketamine used acutely by ambulance service and only occasionally by the emergency department there is very high risk of abuse dependence by robin plumer calculating iv morphine dose morphine gold standard calculate acute pain dose 0 1 mg per kg but less in elderly half this dose so good approach is give half the total dose stat and then the rest over few minutes in children it the sam 0 05 to 0 1 mg per kg consider setting up pca early for patients being admitted with pain that is likely to continue important to remember 1 mg of morphine iv 6 mg morphine orally renal hepatic expect morphine to last up to 24 hours so don give repeated doses other opiates comparison of opiates many tables and calculators exist and they vary wildly in their estimates individual reaction to meds vary so go slowly and remember cross tolerance if switching opiates someone who is opioid tolerant to one drug may not exhibit the same tolerance to another so reduce dose by 50 initially fairly good equivalences morphine morphine codeine oxycodone fentanyl tramadol po iv po po iv po 10 mg 5 mg 60 120 mg 5 7 5mg 100 mcg 50 100 codeine requires conversion to morphine and people vary from fast converters to slow converters cannot predict this tramadol is very dirty drug which lowers the seizure threshold and interacts with ssris and tcas has more constipation and nausea for breakthrough pain figure the 24 hr morphine dose and give 10 20 top up especially important in chronic pain or cancer patients converting to fentanyl patch only in patients on an established dose daily morphine dose mg fentanyl patch mcg less than 60 12 5 60 130 25 135 225 50 225 315 75 315 400 100 converting to methadone is special case and requires consultation with pain specialist or palliative care specialist very roughly methadone 2 5 mg morphine 10 mg it has very long half life approx 5 days so toxicity can accumulate remember adjuvants paracetamol nsaids if appropriate tcas topical therapies lidocaine patch nitrous oxide ketamine also morphine works well subcutaneously an iv is not essential for small doses ie in elderly give ra morph 1 mg ml orally morphine renally excreted so caution in renal failure in crf fentanyl or methadone is preferred or oxycodone if dosing iv remember to give follow up doses 2 3 mg iv initial dosing must be followed up until pain relief is achieved itching from morphine is often histamine reaction not true allergy please do not give oral pain medication in acute abdominal pain not absorbed well irritates gastric lining worsens nausea do not give codeine and tramadol together it like giving 2 nsaids do not layer codeine or tramadol on top of iv morphine if they need iv morphine just continue with enough of the morphine if morphine non responder then try fentanyl constipation side effect that persists with opiate use the hand that writes the opiate should be the hand that writes the laxative prescription or it will be the hand doing the disimpaction laxatives laxsol 2 tabs daily or bd good starting dose up to 3 tabs tds lax sachets usually 1 3 per day but can go higher if needed avoid lactulose or bulk agents as they cause bloating microlax enemas are good too avoid fleet enemas in older patients can cause renal failure anti nausea meds nausea is worst when starting opiates metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hrs phenothiazines ie stemetil haloperidol 5 1 mg or droperidol 625 mg domperidone oral only does not cross blood brain barrier so ok in parkinson ondantreson very constipating ok in parkinsons most antinausea are not ok in parkinsons avoid all phenothiazines including metoclopramide in pd mick killeen oral opiates as general rule no more than 20 tablets should ever be prescribed as patient should be following up with community doctors always check concerto computer chart to see what the previous prescriptions have been all recent prescriptions will be on concerto sevredol controlled drug takes up to 30 minutes to work lasts for 4 hours therefore prescribe four hourly prn children 3 5 years get 5 mg and 5 10 mg for 6 these are medsafe guidelines mst continus morphine la is the drug that replaces sevredol if the patient is on pain relief for longer give same total daily amount but bd with sevredol for breakthrough in ed for acute pain we are usually just prescribing sevredol and the dose is usually 10 mg every 4 hours prn for chronic pain eg cancer patients child oxynorm and oxycontin oxynorm is oxycodone and is short acting opiate which as rule of thumb is twice as powerful as morphine therefore starting dose would be 5 mg 4 hourly oxycontin on the other hand is long acting medication for chronic pain and is generally not prescribed by us it the same principle of working out the dose of short acting in 24 hours and converting this to bd long acting oxycontin not to be given to morphine naive patients tramadol 100mg is equivalent to 10 mg oral morphine it may take half an hour to reach analgesic effect and peak levels are not reached until the second day of 6 hourly dosing as per robins note above don give with ssri and don give in seizure patients renal insufficiency give tramadol bd hepatic consider giving less frequently than 6 hourly naloxone only partially reverses tramadol codeine constipates usually 30mg is as good as 60 mg and increasing dose doesn make any difference rerversed by naloxone regarding opiates for chronic pain see the following video https www youtube com watch g w4dvp0qqg it a little bit more complicated that that but this is our philosophy on the routine prescribing of opiates for chronic non cancer pain we have to learn from our american colleagues who have seen an exponential rise in opiate abuse in recent years non steroidal anti inflammatory medication brufen ibuprofen is the go to nsaid in our emergency department mostly this is because it has the best side effect profile dose 400mg 6 hourly to max of 1800 per day renal impairment ok until crcl 30 then contraindicated ok in elderly heart failure ischemic heart disease unless any of these 3 last categories are severe in patients at potential risk it is considered efficacious to co treat with ppi not to be given to patients on

cvp an echo based multivariable tool that assesses fetal hemodynamics in multicenter cohort of fetuses with ebstein anomaly tricuspid valve dysplasia ea tvd using scale of 0 to 10 cvp may help predict outcomes in fetuses with growth restriction and congenital heart defects previous pilot study showed that cvp score under 7 was associated with poorer survival the researchers performed 23 center retrospective review of fetal echo data and outcomes in cohort of 243 fetuses diagnosed with ea tvd from 2005 to 2011 evaluating the first and last fetal echo in gestation the team found that fetuses with cvp scores below 7 on the first or last fetal echo were less likely to survive suggesting that this score may be valuable tool to help guide fetal counseling freire ga et al all children hospital

benefit children after heart surgery this pilot study investigated approaches to treating pain and anxiety among children who underwent heart surgery researchers at lucile packard children hospital stanford and cincinnati children hospital medical center studied whether providing 30 minute sessions of massage therapy to children would reduce their need for opioids and benzodiazepines to address postsurgical pain and anxiety the study team randomized 60 patients aged 6 to 19 into two groups one receiving standard of care plus two to three sessions of massage therapy per week other receiving standard care plus three 30 minute reading sessions during their hospitalization the children who received massage therapy used less benzodiazepines in the first five post operative days than those

1222,preoperative diagnoses empyema of the left chest and consolidation of the left lung postoperative diagnoses empyema of the left chest consolidation of the left lung lung abscesses of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe operative procedure left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscesses and multiple biopsies of pleura and lung anesthesia general findings the patient has complex history which goes back about four months ago when she started having respiratory symptoms and one week ago she was admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two cat scans of chest she was found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax there was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung the patient had 30 year history of cigarette smoking chest tube was placed at the other hospital which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor actually what was thought to be fecal like odor then an abdominal ct scan was done which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal ct the patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room where there was to be thoracoscopy performed the patient had flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out this was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline in the bronchus following the bronchoscopy double lumen tube was placed but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day the patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment today the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted these were suctioned but it was enough to produce temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus eventually the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that the chest tube tract which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get acceptable visualization through this tract second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout remarkably the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with fibrotic line but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe there were many pockets of purulent material which had gray white appearance to it there was quite bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe the adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time there seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed many cultures were taken from several areas the most remarkable finding was large cavity which was probably about 11 cm in dimension containing grayish pus and also caseous like material it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue perhaps deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity the apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm procedure and technique with the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner the chest tube had been removed and initially blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this therefore the next incision for thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and little bit better visualization was achieved but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space quite bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and frozen section of one of the most quite dense suture ligatures of prolene were required when the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with tissue pledget of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with prolene sutures also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis 14 french foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the foley catheter was removed the patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity also on the pulmonary artery repair some material was used and also thrombin gelfoam and surgicel after reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline as mentioned biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung then two 24 blake chest tubes were placed one through stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk one was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex these were later connected to water seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure good hemostasis was observed sponge count was reported as being correct intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth sixth and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table so that pericostal sutures were used with 1 vicryl the chest wall was closed with running 1 vicryl and then 2 0 vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin the chest tubes were connected to water seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure sterile dressings were applied the patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition ,yes

1230,operations 1 mitral valve repair using quadrangular resection of the p2 segment of the posterior leaflet 2 mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using cosgrove galloway medtronic fuser band 3 posterior leaflet abscess resection anesthesia general endotracheal anesthesia times aortic cross clamp time was minutes cardiopulmonary bypass time total was minutes procedure in detail after obtaining informed consent from the patient including thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered next the patient chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion 10 blade scalpel was used to make midline median sternotomy incision dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using bovie electrocautery the sternum was opened with sternal saw and full dose heparinization was given next the chest retractor was positioned the pericardium was opened with bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned we then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass 2 0 ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine next double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted 3 0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage through this was passed our sec cannula this was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in y shaped circuit next 3 0 prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula this was likewise connected to the connection of our venous cannula portion we then used 4 0 stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter which was inserted cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the svc and ivc which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape sondergaard groove was taken down next an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta this was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter next the aorta was cross clamped and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole next 15 blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium the left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker next our self retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view of note was the fact that the mitral valve p2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it the borders of the p2 segment abscess were defined by using right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with 4 0 silk after doing so the p2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with 11 blade scalpel given the laxity of the posterior leaflet it was decided to reconstruct it with 2 0 ethibond pledgeted suture this was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion prior to doing so care was taken to remove any debris and abscess type material the pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied next the more anterior portion of the p2 segment was reconstructed by running 4 0 prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it this was done without difficulty the apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle there was noted to be small amount of central regurgitation it was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure next 2 0 non pledgeted ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion care was taken to go from trigone to trigone prior to placing these sutures the annulus was sized and noted to be size for the cosgrove galloway suture band ring from medtronic after as mentioned we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus and they were passed through the cg suture band the suture band was lowered into position and tied in place we then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation we subsequently removed our self retaining retractor we closed our left atriotomy using 4 0 prolene in running fashion this was done without difficulty we de aired the heart we then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity we then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with 5 0 prolene we placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin the patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed we then gave full dose protamine and after noting that there was no evidence of protamine reaction we removed our aortic cannula this site was buttressed with 4 0 prolene on an sh needle the patient tolerated the procedure well we placed mediastinal 32 french chest tube as well as right chest blake drain the mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding there were none we closed the sternum with 7 sternal wires in interrupted figure of eight fashion the fascia was closed with 1 vicryl followed by 2 0 vicryl followed by 3 0 vicryl in running subcuticular fashion the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition ,yes

1234,this is something that have noticed and m just curious if what m experiencing is considered shortness of breath first of all let me mention that ve had palpitations for years in 2014 had an ekg and holter monitor which both came back normal but also had stress test which revealed congenital heart defect that never knew had it a bav bicuspid aortic valve apparently was on the mild end of any problems and my cardiologist told me to just continue what do and not to have any restrictions on anything and follow up in two years he also mentioned that this sort of thing does not cause pain and that wouldn just drop dead yes asked about that haha however over time this could lead to heart failure but that would be at the extreme end of things and would definitely know before that point because would have trouble even walking across the room so here is my question am getting ready to start an exercise program but haven exercised in about year so m definitely not in shape however m not considered really overweight either last week did two short minute long tabata exercises and noticed that when just stood and slowly jumped side to side and did boxing type punch felt like had no air to breath in and this wheezing sound came out of me almost like if someone knocked the wind out of you or you pushed the air out of something really fast don experience that any other time but when m doing that punching type move is that shortness of breath have no idea what should look for or feel but it a very weird feeling it also concerns me that maybe shouldn jump into this upcoming exercise routine but another part of me is saying that haven been exercising in long time and that could simply be out of shape do have two year follow up with my cardiologist next month and will mention this but just wanted to know if any of you have experienced anything like this before thank you for your thoughts ,yes

1244,chart note she is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow dr xyz had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath then she had the pulmonary function test and ct scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see dr xyz estep he had concurred with dr xyz that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both dr xyz and were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy she was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath she is very concerned about the findings on her cat scan and pulmonary function test she seemed alarmed to report that dr xyz had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60 of what should be normal however told her that two years ago dr xyz did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function and that really her pulmonary function test at least compared from two years ago had not really changed over this period of time after discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years the fact that she likely has number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath which is deconditioning and obesity she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy in fact when called dr xyz to talk to him about cancelling the procedure he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed also explained to patient that did not think dr xyz was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those and also spoke with dr xyz who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate that generally person with progressive interstitial lung disease without fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities had 30 minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her cat scan ray and pulmonary function tests and if there was some sign that this was progressive problem she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy but she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her she understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful we are going to see her back in month to see how her breathing is doing we will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with pulmonologist at that time told her would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two ,yes

1257,preoperative diagnosis aortic stenosis postoperative diagnosis aortic stenosis procedures performed 1 insertion of mm toronto stentless porcine valve 2 cardiopulmonary bypass 3 cold cardioplegia arrest of the heart anesthesia general endotracheal anesthesia estimated blood loss 300 cc intravenous fluids 1200 cc of crystalloid urine output 250 cc aortic cross clamp time cardiopulmonary bypass time total procedure in detail after obtaining informed consent from the patient including thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered next the neck chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion we used 10 blade scalpel to make midline median sternotomy incision dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using bovie electrocautery the sternum was opened with sternal saw the chest retractor was positioned next full dose heparin was given the pericardium was opened pericardial stay sutures were positioned after obtaining adequate act we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass 2 0 double pursestring of ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine next 3 0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine 4 0 stitch was placed in the right atrium retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site next scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein 4 0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein next right angle sump was placed at this position we then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery the aorta was completely encircled next an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta we then prepared to cross clamp the aorta we went down on our flows and cross clamped the aorta we backed up our flows we then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart the patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected after initially arresting the heart to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit next after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve and 4 0 tycron sutures were placed in the commissures in addition 2 0 prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view next scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus we then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be mm stentless porcine toronto valve we prepared the valve next we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4 0 tycron sutures for the annulus we started with our individual commissural stitches they were connected to our valve sewing ring next we placed 5 interrupted 4 0 tycron sutures in subannular fashion at each commissural position after doing so we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the toronto stentless porcine valve the valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied next we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia next we sewed our distal suture line we began with the left coronary cusp of the valve we ran 5 0 rb needle up both sides of the valve care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia this procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve again care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia lastly we sewed our non coronary cusp this was done without difficulty at this point we inspected our aortic valve there was good coaptation of the leaflets and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia the antegrade portion was given in direct ostial fashion once again we now turned our attention to closing the aorta 4 0 prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in running fashion just prior to closing we de aired the heart and gave warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia at this point we removed our aortic cross clamp the heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity we placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires we removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4 0 prolene on an sh needle we removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter we oversewed that site with 5 0 prolene by now the heart was de aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity we began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass we then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with 2 silk we then gave full dose protamine after knowing that there was no evidence of protamine reaction we removed the aortic cannula we buttressed that site with 4 0 prolene on an sh needle we placed mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin we also placed 2 blake drains 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions they were brought out through the skin the sternum was closed with 7 wires in an interrupted figure of eight fashion the fascia was closed with 1 vicryl we closed the subcu tissue with 2 0 vicryl and the skin with 4 0 pds ,yes

1260,i guess you could say we re going back to the future return to tomorrow was published in 1954 towards the tail end of hubbard golden age pulp writer period but before his criminal cult leader period began in earnest it actually debuted four years earlier as to the stars two part story in the monthly astounding science fiction which is why the only wikipedia page for return to tomorrow refers to star trek episode and think this means that the book cover is lying to me when it claims this story is an ace book original novel never before published not even an asterisk explaining as complete story to cover their asses as you can see from that cover this here a vintage sci fi story we ve got classic rocket ships landed on their tail ends we ve got sleek weapons that can only be ray guns and we ve got useless fins on the helmets of the space suits which refer to with sarcastic quotation marks because the things don even have gloves at least put on some mittens dearie space is cold our story hook on the back cover is shanghaied into eternity our protagonist alan corday is doomed to be captured by captain jocelyn to crew spaceship since not even wealth and women were sufficient to fill his crew vacancies that because of the terrible price you pay for sailing between worlds which will be elaborated on later so we re due for mutiny swashbuckling pirates and the acrid fumes of war of annihilation as mr corday tries to get home also m tickled that women is listed as lure to entice sailors you there strapping young lad would you like to leave your old life behind and sign on for months of labor inside cold steel shell wrapped in the colder void of space possibly to never see your home world again no you might get laid ve reconsidered but what is this fearsome price that all star sailors must pay perhaps the prologue will elaborate space is deep man is small and time is his relentless enemy do we have to be so disparaging can we say that man is big but space is just bigger in an ancient and forgotten age the early 20th century he first discovered the barricade before space travel first began he knew the barricade was there it was an equation without the equation the basic equation of mass and time man could not have progressed beyond barbaric fire er think we had at least made it to the medieval age maybe even the industrial era before busting out this particular physics equation but he did progress oh well objection withdrawn then mean if you are going to immediately contradict yourself and he used fission and his mechanicians did you mean machinations became mighty and his hopes large but the terms of his salvation were the terms of his imprisonment as well as mass approaches infinity time approaches zero ah see as man sits on the couch and eats microwave dinners he gains weight exponentially but his time runs out and he dies of heart failure the narrator credits this equation to lortentz and fitzgerald and especially theoretical philosopher named einstein with the power of this equation that man fellow was able to colonize the solar system yet at the same time it almost denied to him the stars and by almost mean didn and yet despite the difficulty derived by these great men and confirmed first by nuclear physicists and then by actual use there were still those who accepted and yet defied the law small cohort of ships and men who throughout the ages have kept the routes alive the outcasts and pariahs of extra atmosphere travel the cursed and shunned by man they course their lonely ways far bound but prisoners too shackled fast by time knowing well their waiting fate who would volunteer to become part of that thin group er the outcasts and pariahs those cursed and shunned by but amongst the societies of man there are always those who are outcasts from character or force of circumstance and there are adventurers who will not heed equations and so the stars were reached and partially explored despite the fact of those who made the runs this narrator is going to keep answering his own questions by repeating information he gave before asking them also my hunch is that supposed to be despite the fate of those who made the runs but let get down to the brass tacks whatever those are these outcasts take what called the long passage to places like alpha centauri which spaceship can reach in six weeks sometimes they re earnest adventurers sometimes they re criminals and fugitives trying to evade capture at any rate if they ever get back to their port of origin they ll find it irrevocably changed because while it a six week voyage for them many years will have passed planetside this can be bit inconvenient he who is gone for century cannot well return he knows too little his people are dead he has no place and he does not fit and what may have begun as an adventure for crew invariably ended in the same way another passage out while behind them further age accumulated while the crew stayed young the only fraternity was within the ship the only hope was that some day someone might discover another equation solution to the barricade as mass approaches the speed of light time approaches zero the outcasts of the long passage those that stayed alive never ceased to hope see this is story about time dilation and true to form the author is muddling it up as ve said before my career in hard science was cut short by some bad experiences in high school so m not the most qualified person to discuss this topic but as far as ve been able to piece together the idea goes like this the faster you re moving compared to another frame of reference the less time seems to pass for you by their standards on your spaceship zipping around at warp whatever you wouldn notice anything weird but if you went back to earth you find that your ship clocks marked less time on your voyage than what your departure and return times on earth would indicate thus flying around at high speeds is form of one way only forward time travel as for where mass enters his equation err think hubbard latched on to the notion of relativistic mass but don think this actually means you get bigger or anything as you approach lightspeed and the time approaches zero bit is also perplexing since it would imply that what as you move fast you get bigger and then stop moving at all it probably better to ignore this cruel equation altogether and just keep in mind that weeks aboard spaceship can equal years for your family back home except it sounds like this story is going to be about trying to find breakthrough new equation this could be problematic story based on solving misunderstanding of advanced physics ,no

1262,new details possible treatment in the link between heart disease and sleep apnea people with obstructive sleep apnea are at significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease the relationship between the two conditions is complex and the mechanisms by which they may trigger or exacerbate one another are not yet well understood but the fundamental connection between osa and cardiovascular disease is strong studies indicated that obstructive sleep apnea is 2 3 times more prevalent among people with cardiovascular disease than those without research shows that the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease is higher among older adults who also have osa sleep apnea is linked to several cardiovascular conditions including high blood pressure arrhythmia heart disease heart failure and stroke two common conditions cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among adults in the united states obstructive sleep apnea affects an estimated 25 million or more s adults with the great majority of cases remaining undiagnosed and untreated deepening our understanding of the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease is critical to public health how osa may trigger heart disease recent research reveals new details in the relationship between heart disease and sleep apnea and also points to possible treatment for lowering cardiovascular risks for people with osa scientists at columbia university medical center found that statins type of drug used to treat cholesterol may reverse the damage done to the cardiovascular system that appears to occur as consequence of sleep apnea the scientists also identified new information about the process by which obstructive sleep apnea may inflict cardiovascular damage according to the study people with osa exhibit abnormalities in protein that helps to limit cellular inflammation the dysfunction with this particular protein known as cd59 appears to leave people with obstructive sleep apnea more vulnerable to inflammation which is regarded as significant contributor to cardiovascular disease the study included 128 people including 78 with diagnosis of sleep apnea and 52 who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for osa scientists analyzed blood samples from all participants looking in particular at endothelial cells cells that line the interior walls of blood vessels the protein cd59 is normally found in these cells lining blood vessel walls from within the cell lining cd59 works to prevent the buildup of inflammatory proteins on the surface of cells scientists found that among people with obstructive sleep apnea cd59 levels were elevated compared to those without osa researchers found something else both surprising and significant in people with sleep apnea cd59 protein was found primarily within the interior section of blood vessel cells rather than in the cells lining as would have been expected and was the case among people without sleep apnea at greater distance from cell walls the cd59 protein was less able to exert its protective effect against inflammation the result greater build up of inflammatory proteins on the cells of people with obstructive sleep apnea researchers found statins solution included in the study were small number of subjects with osa who were already being treated with statins among this sub group of sleep apnea sufferers researchers discovered that cd59 remained in place in the lining of cells in position to inhibit inflammation similar to people without osa additional research found that in people with osa the inward migration of cd59 is influenced by cholesterol this finding is important opening the possibility of statins use as therapy to prevent cardiovascular damage in people with obstructive sleep apnea further study needs to take place before we ll know whether statins can serve as viable treatment to prevent or reverse the cardiovascular damage from osa but this is promising lead more broadly this study also provides some much needed insight into the process by which obstructive sleep apnea affects cardiovascular health and function the disrupted breathing of osa obstructive sleep apnea involves repeated interruptions to normal breathing during sleep during sleep the airway temporarily narrows or closes altogether compromising or fully interrupting breath flow these episodes of shallow or paused breathing can last few seconds or more than minute in cases of mild sleep apnea breathing is interrupted between 5 15 times an hours in cases of moderate to severe sleep apnea breathing is interrupted 15 30 times an hour or more people with osa are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease as well as other serious medical conditions including type 2 diabetes and depression they are also at significantly greater risk for accident and injury in large part because of the tiredness and fatigue that accompany this sleep disorder undiagnosed and untreated why do so many cases of obstructive sleep apnea go undiagnosed often people with sleep apnea aren aware of their most obvious symptoms since they occur during sleep snoring and other sounds of disrupted breathing during sleep can be signs of sleep apnea bed partners are frequently the people who are aware of these symptoms before the sleepers themselves even when people are aware they snore or breathe with difficulty during sleep they too often don address these issues with their physicians and physicians themselves often don make the topic of sleep and questions about sleep disordered breathing priority during physicals and check ups what more many people aren aware of the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that exist in addition to snoring dry mouth or sore throat upon waking headaches especially in the morning severe tiredness during the daytime trouble with concentration memory problems mood issues including depression anxiety and irritability the regular presence of any of these symptoms even in the absence of snoring warrants conversation with physician treatment works for osa sleep apnea can wreak havoc with nightly rest undermining health and daily performance the good news is that osa can be treated effectively with number of different therapies cpap continuous positive airway pressure therapy is highly effective in reducing or eliminating sleep apnea and is generally the recommended treatment for more severe cases of osa other forms of pap or positive airway pressure are also used to treat osa oral appliances devices worn inside the mouth during sleep can also significantly improve sleep apnea and are increasingly recommended for mild and moderate sleep apnea as well as for people who have difficulty using cpap therapy positional therapy switching sleeping position is the simplest form of sleep apnea treatment and can be effective particularly in cases of mild osa airway obstructions and disrupted breathing are more likely to occur when sleeping on one back moving to side sleeping position can reduce the frequency of interrupted breathing episodes and may even resolve mild sleep apnea in some cases lifestyle modifications including losing weight also help to alleviate osa we need to improve our diagnosis rates osa and get more people into treatment for sleep apnea and the other health complications that often accompany the disorder this latest research provides some significant new insight into how sleep apnea works to undermine heart health and may indicate new way to treat and protect people with sleep apnea against cardiovascular risks sweet

1265,are the rings on your fingers feeling tight or maybe your shoes pinch or feel tight suddenly does your skin retain the indent for few seconds after being pressed these and some other symptoms such as stiff joints and bloated tummy may indicate fluid or water retention in your body also called edema this condition is generally an annoyance but can also signal more serious underlying conditions water retention occurs when fluid gets trapped in the body tissues generally the feet ankles and legs causes pressure within veins or damage to them causes them to leak blood plasma that is mainly water into neighboring tissues this fluid pools in the feet and ankles but may also be more generalized through the entire body sitting on long plane ride standing for long periods of time dietary deficiencies insufficient vitamin b12 or protein hormones associated with the menstrual cycle or with pregnancy reaction to hot weather in the summer months and certain medications can all cause water retention consuming food and drinks high in salt content and weakened valves in the deep veins of the legs are also causes of water retention if the swelling is mild and resolves itself within few days then the condition is not alarming the excess fluid is absorbed by the body when you sleep but if the swelling persists or worsens or you experience shortness of breath along with it then the condition may be worrisome as it may signal liver kidney or thyroid disease or even heart failure treatments perhaps the easiest way to combat water retention is to reduce your sodium intake if you are prone to getting edema also avoid sitting or standing for extended periods of time including more protein in your diet may also be beneficial as it encourages your body to remove excess fluid similarly foods rich in potassium think bananas also help to remove excess fluids dehydrating drinks such as coffee tea and alcohol should be avoided monitoring medications that you may be taking for other medical conditions and changing the medication or dosage may also help to relieve water retention in more severe cases of water retention doctor may prescribe diuretic to reduce swelling other treatments for edema depend upon the cause severity and other specific related conditions if any during pregnancy for example excessive swelling may indicate preeclampsia serious condition which may be treated by bed rest medications and other treatments as seen fit by your doctor one sided swelling may indicate vein inflammation condition called phlebitis which you may also need to see doctor for generally speaking water retention is temporary and relatively harmless condition that can fix itself within few days however it can also signal more serious medical condition if the less worrisome symptoms persist are severe or are accompanied by other serious symptoms such as chest pain and cough get medical help right away in such situation image credit ,no

1283, latvia crocodile harry inspiration for hollywood adelaide australia this vast antipodean island is famous for its unforgiving and beautiful outback kangaroos populate the plains koalas hang in the trees and kookaburras flutter through the skies above while venomous snakes often slither quietly through the reeds ready to strike at moment notice it is in australia long and winding rivers where you really have to watch out as lurking beneath the surface could be the smiling face of deadly crocodile the dangers of crocodiles are well known here so well known that in earlier times crocodile hunters would often become celebrities renowned throughout australia for their courage and skill the most famous of them all was crocodile harry and curiously he was latvian who hailed from the village of dundaga in the region of kurzeme 124 kilometers from riga distance many australians would describe as close to latvia capital known primarily for its 13th century medieval castle the village of dundaga commemorates crocodile harry whose latvian name is arvids blumentals with massive two ton concrete sculpture of one the largest of all living reptiles and terrestrial predators in the world the most dangerous extant crocodilian to humans saltwater crocodile it remains an enigma to many baffled visitors of the town visitors who may be unaware of the dundaga infamous son who was born there in 1925 but emigrated to australia in 1951 depicted with wide glaring eyes with sharp long teeth housed in long snouted muzzle and in crouching attack position this sculpture represents formidable and opportunistic hyper carnivorous ambush predator it is in memory of all of dundaga strong men and the strongest was blumentals so reads the plaque attached to the sculpture blumentals was known to chameleon character adapting quickly to his new environment and the difference between the two environments could hardly be more pronounced moving from latvia boreal forests to australia dusty outback could not have been easy and culturally the change required for blumental must have been enormous setting off to australia was path taken by many latvians in the years after world war two but hunting crocodiles in the outback means that all too often you re on your own even his name provided difficulties arvids was hard name for australians to pronounce so he changed it to harry 10 000 crocs blumenthals larger than life adventurous story may seem like good piece of bush folklore particularly to australians but whether real or just perhaps made up his exploits have appeared in newspaper articles and magazines across the world numerous documentary films they say as many as 30 and countless tv features have been made about blumenthal colourful life crocodile harry allegedly killed whopping 10 000 crocodiles over 13 year period while in australia blumenthal also caught smaller crocodiles which were up to two metres in length with only his bare hands hollywood star it has been noted that blumenthal may have been the prototype to the 1986 hollywood comedy film crocodile dundee but this gets you into controversial waters as it has been widely disputed the film was set in the australian outback and starred the australian actor paul hogan in the lead role of the weathered mick dundee crocodile hunter crocodile hunting was banned in australia in 1968 which saw blumentals settling in opal town of coober pedy in the state of south australia town considered the opal mining capital of the world in coober pedy an anglicised version of the aboriginal words kupa piti meaning white man in hole the former latvian crocodile hunter tried his hand at opal mining and was to rapidly achieve legendary status with his exploits it was in coober pedy that he excavated his extravagant and bizarre underground dugout home typical of coober pedy which was to become one of the town most prominent and popular tourist attractions it was proposed for heritage listing in 2007 known as the crocodile nest blumenthals dugout constructed in an underground cave carved out of hillside is situated 5 kilometres from the town centre near the four mile opal field blumentals directed all his creative energy into his dugout which featured tribal graffiti covered walls festooned with women under garments and signatures of over 1 000 virgins scrawled on the walls by female visitors who stayed in his dugout it is also adorned with weird sculptures created by blumentals own hands his clutter filled residence was featured in the 1985 australian post apocalyptic action adventure film mad max 3 beyond thunderdome which starred mel gibson and tina turner near the entrance of the dugout the film crew upon concluding filming erected sculpture which they named the orchestra when the wind blows the sculpture reverberates in the stillness of the desert in performance of eclectic sounds the death certificate records von blumentals arvids croc harry death on oct 13 2006 he was to later declare himself latvian baron forced to leave latvia at the conclusion of the second world war buried in plot 234 of cobber pedy boot hill cemetery blumentals was 81 years of age when he died of

who is being evaluated as part of preoperative workup for mitral and possible aortic valve repair or replacement she has had atrial fibrillation and previous episodes of congestive heart failure she has dyspnea on exertion and occasionally orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea procedure after the risks benefits and alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where the procedure was performed the right inguinal area was thoroughly cleansed with betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner 1 lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area once adequate anesthesia had been attained thing wall argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral vein guidewire was advanced into the lumen of the vein without resistance the needle was removed and the guidewire was secured to the sterile field the needle was flushed and then used to cannulate the right femoral artery guidewire was advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance small nick was made in the skin and the needle was removed this pressure was held 6 french arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance the dilator and guidewire were removed fio2 sample was obtained and the sheath was flushed an 8 french sheath was advanced over the guidewire into the femoral vein after which the dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed swan ganz catheter was advanced through

1297,preprocedure diagnosis left leg claudication postprocedure diagnosis left leg claudication operation performed aortogram with bilateral segmental lower extremity run off anesthesia conscious sedation indication for procedure the patient presents with lower extremity claudication she is 68 year old woman who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding infection arterial trauma requiring surgery access issues and recurrence she appears to understand and agrees to proceed description of procedure the patient was taken to the angio suite placed in supine position after adequate conscious sedation both groins were prepped with chloraseptic prep cloth towels and paper drapes were placed local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance the common femoral artery was accessed guidewire was threaded followed by 4 french sheath through the 4 french sheath 4 french omni flush catheter was placed the glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery using power injector an aortogram proceeded the catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation timed run off view of both legs was performed and due to very abnormal and delayed run off in the left opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach the catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using glidewire obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery the omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery the glidewire rather exchanged for an amplatz stiff wire this was left in place and the 4 french sheath removed and replaced with 6 french destination 45 cm sheath this was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed identified functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty the patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate glidewire was carefully advanced using roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels 4 mm 4 cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question final views after dilatation revealed dissection search for 5 mm stent was performed but none of this was available for this reason used 6 mm 80 mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery post dilatation was performed with 4 mm angioplasty balloon further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery no significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan for this reason chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg then performed closure of the right femoral artery with 6 french angio seal device attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified guidewire was threaded followed by 4 french sheath this was immediately exchanged for the 6 french destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery the glidewire was exchanged for the amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath the destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery for this reason performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4 mm balloon minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation no further significant abnormality was identified to avoid placing stent in the small vessel left it alone and approached the popliteal artery 3 mm balloon was chosen to dilate 50 to 79 popliteal artery stenosis reasonable use were obtained and possibly 4 mm balloon could have been used however due to her propensity for dissection opted not to then exchanged the glidewire for an o1 for thruway guidewire using an exchange length this was placed into the left posterior tibial artery 2 mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel final images showed improved run off to the right calf the destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an angio seal deployed findings aortogram demonstrates dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma no evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally there is single left renal artery the infrarenal aorta both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal on the right superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally at the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run off through the posterior tibial artery is noted the perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf the dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level on the left the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent again at the distal third of the thigh there is functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery this was successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement the popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis the tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice impression 1 normal bilateral renal arteries with small accessory right renal artery 2 normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries 3 the proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the

1308, remember when adult stem cell advocates were called anti science by the embryonic stem cell lobby for arguing that we could have our regenerative medicine and non contentious ethics too do well the so called anti scientists had it far more right than their accusers adult stem cells from patients own bodies have been shown in studies to halve deaths from heart failure in comparison to patients receiving placebo from the telegraph story stem cells can repair damaged heart and potentially halve the number of people dying from heart failure scientists have shown in major breakthrough for regenerative medicine now in the largest trial ever conducted doctors in the us have proven that even the most serious cases of heart failure can be repaired using stem cells harvested from patient own bone marrow end stage patients whose only hope was heart transplant were treated with stem cells in single operation doctors found the group were 37 per cent less likely to have been admitted to hospital in the 12 months following the operation and half as likely to have died than those on placebo did google search and found very few stories covering this wonderful breakthrough how telling about media bias still in the tank for the embryonic approach indeed if this had been an embryonic stem cell breakthrough you would have heard the headlines don be surprised if the next embryonic stem cell animal study brings greater news coverage than this very hopeful story of an ethical technique now alleviating great human suffering image credit sergey nivens dollar photo club cross posted at human exceptionalism ,no

1312,she was evaluated this m and was without any significant clinical change her white count has been improving and down to 12 000 chest ray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates but no acute cardiopulmonary change there was suggestion of bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia she has been on zosyn for the infection throughout her hospitalization we have been trying to adjust her pain medications she states that the methadone did not work for her she was immune to oxycodone she had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that there was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness she also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder apparently her husband was in this afternoon he had box of her pain medications it is unclear whether she took bunch of these or precisely what happened was contacted that she was less responsive she periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications which she has been requesting repeatedly though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain the nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point there was concern that she had taken some medications from home she was given narcan and appeared to come around some breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi which certainly changed from this m additional narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse possible benzodiazepine toxicity with o2 via mask oxygenation was stable at 90 to 95 after initial hypoxia was noted chest ray was obtained at this time an ecg was obtained which shows sinus tachycardia noted to have ischemic abnormalities in light of the acute decompensation she was then transferred to the icu we will continue the iv zosyn respiratory protocol with respiratory management continue alprazolam r but avoid if she appears sedated we will attempt to avoid additional pain medications but we will continue with the dilaudid for time being suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder pulmonary medicine associates have been contacted to consult in light of the icu admission at this juncture she does not appear to need an intubation pending chest ray she may require additional iv furosemide ,yes
1313,hi ardnaxela wecome to grace congratulations on your good response initially to chemo radiation and now to crizotinib m sorry to hear of the symptoms your pleural effusion is causing but as dr west has stated by the formal criteria used in clinical trials to assess for response or progression change in pleural effusion does not constitute significant change in disease status this is because inflammation or infection or even heart failure can cause an effusion and it also product not just of production of fluid but also the draining ability there are enough variables that we prefer to see it decrease or resolve but we don consider worsening effusion as clear evidence of progression http cancergrace org topic chronic cough and difference of opinion post 1261710 perhaps you can get symptom relief by draining the effusion or further intervention may be possible and desirable such as pleurodesis procedure in which substance is inserted into the pleural space in an effort to cause the layers of the pleura to stick together eliminating the friction which causes the fluid to build up you may want to read dr west post on options for managing recurrent pleural effusions jimc forum moderator,no

loss 3 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 4 changes consistent with acute and chronic bronchitis 5 severe mucosal irregularity with endobronchial narrowing of the right middle and lower lobes 6 left vocal cord irregularity procedure performed fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy with lavage brushings and endobronchial mucosal biopsies of the right bronchus intermedius right lower lobe anesthesia demerol 50 mg with versed 3 mg as well as topical cocaine and lidocaine solution location of procedure endoscopy suite 4 after informed consent was obtained and following the review of the procedure including procedure as well as possible risks and complications were explained and consent was previously obtained the patient was sedated with the above stated medication and the patient was continuously monitored on pulse oximetry noninvasive blood pressure and ekg monitoring prior to starting the procedure the patient was noted to have baseline oxygen saturation of 86 on room air subsequently she was given bronchodilator treatment with atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90 to 91 on room air the patient was placed on supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above stated medication as this occurred the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx the cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation there was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea which was midline in nature the bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled at this time the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion the mucosa was diffusely friable throughout bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled at this point the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius at this time it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening the mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine at this time bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed at the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible so the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized at this time bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty at this time the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius at this time multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed after completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments the bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea at this time bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem additional lidocaine was instilled the bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments there was no endobronchial lesion visualized there is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout no endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system the bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system at this time bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared there is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout the bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room during the bronchoscopy the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing fio2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93 to 94 the patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure the patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea this was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure the patient did receive nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well the patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above the patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms she was advised regarding smoking cessation the patient was also placed on prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg day

1340,when you think about massive heart attack you probably imagine someone who suddenly clutches their chest and collapses this is not always the scenario even with large heart attack although some heart attacks are more dramatic than others heart attack is always serious whether heart attack is mild or severe you can improve your odds of living the longest healthiest life possible if you know what to do what causes heart attacks all heart attacks occur when circulation of blood to the heart is blocked if the blockage is not rapidly opened heart tissue will die from lack of oxygen most often heart attack also called myocardial infarction mi is result of coronary heart disease chd coronary heart disease is narrowing of the coronary arteries which bring blood into the heart muscle coronary heart disease is most often caused by atherosclerosis buildup of fatty plaque on the artery walls narrowed coronary arteries reduce blood flow to the heart muscle and can cause chest pain angina especially during exercise or stress in addition blood clots form more easily in narrowed artery damaged by fatty plaques blood clot can completely block blood flow causing heart attack and life threatening heart damage angina is not heart attack but if it does not go away with rest or after taking nitroglycerin it is sign of developing heart attack what is mild heart attack mild heart attack affects relatively small portion of the heart muscle or does not cause much permanent heart damage this is because the blockage in coronary artery occurs in small artery that supplies small portion of the heart muscle does not completely block blood flow to the heart or lasts briefly it is common misconception that mild heart attack is not serious even if the area of the heart affected is small heart attack can result in permanent heart damage and life threatening problems that affect you for the rest of your life including heart failure an abnormal heart beat arrhythmia and higher risk of second heart attack what is massive heart attack massive heart attack affects large portion of the heart muscle or causes large amount of heart damage this can happen if the blockage in coronary artery occurs in large artery that supplies large portion of the heart completely blocks blood flow to the heart or lasts for long period of time massive heart attack can result in collapse cardiac arrest when your heart stops beating and rapid death or permanent heart damage massive heart attack can also lead to heart failure arrhythmia and higher risk of second hear,no

enrolled in blinded study where she may receive drug for prophylaxis against mucositis which has at least one reported incident of acceleration of preexisting tachycardia recommendations 1 atrial fibrillation the patient is currently hemodynamically stable tolerating her dysrhythmia however given the risk of thromboembolic complications would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours we will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous iv bolus followed by mg minute at this juncture if she does not have spontaneous cardioversion we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone as part of amiodarone protocol please check tsh given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases we will follow lfts closely while on amiodarone 2 thromboembolic risk prophylaxis as discussed above no immediate indication for anticoagulation if however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours we will need to initiate therapy this was discussed with dr preference would be to run intravenous heparin with ptt of 45 during her thrombocytopenic nadir and initiation of full dose anticoagulation once nadir is resolved 3 congestive heart failure the

1369,view more jobs your weight as teenager is linked to your risk of heart failure in early middle age research that followed more than 1 6 million swedish men from adolescence onwards between 1968 and 2005 has shown that those who were overweight as teenagers were more likely to develop heart failure in early middle age surprisingly the increased risk of heart failure was found in men who were within the normal body weight range body mass index of 18 5 to 25 in adolescence with an increased risk starting in those with bmi of 20 and rising steeply to nearly ten fold increased risk in those who were very obese with bmi of 35 or over research that followed more than 1 6 million swedish men from adolescence onwards between 1968 and 2005 has shown that those who were overweight as teenagers were more likely to develop heart failure in early middle age surprisingly the increased risk of heart failure was found in men who were within the normal body weight range body mass index of 18 5 to 25 in adolescence with an increased risk starting in those with bmi of 20 and rising steeply to nearly ten fold increased risk in those who were very obese with bmi of 35 or over the study which is published today friday in the european heart journal 1 found that in men with bmi of 20 and over the risk of heart failure increased by 16 with every bmi unit after adjustments for factors that could affect the findings such as age year of enlistment into the swedish armed forces other diseases parental education blood pressure iq muscle strength and fitness annika rosengren professor of medicine at the sahlgrenska academy gothenburg sweden who led the research said although most studies define normal weight as having bmi between 18 5 and 25 this is probably not an appropriate definition in the young most of whom are naturally thin this may be why we see an increase in the risk of heart failure starting at fairly low bmi level however it was surprising to see the very steep increase in risk with increasing body weight above bmi of 20 given the global trend for growing numbers of teenagers to be overweight and obese our findings suggest that heart failure which in this study occurred at the relatively early average age of about 47 may well become major threat to health worldwide this serves to underline the urgent need for action worldwide to curb the obesity epidemic action needs to be taken by governments as well as by individuals for instance by creating an environment that does not promote overweight and obesity and that encourages people not to be sedentary and not to eat more than they need this is more important than hassling people into dieting whatever shape they are once established overweight and obesity is much harder to tackle until recently swedish law required all 18 year old swedish men to enlist in the armed forces and between 1968 and 2005 total of 1 810 348 men enlisted and underwent standardised physical and cognitive examinations for this study professor rosengren and her colleagues analysed data on 1 610 437 men from the swedish conscript registry they followed the men from the time they enlisted at 18 for between five to 42 years an average follow up time of 23 years during that time 5 492 men were admitted to hospital for heart failure with an average age at diagnosis of nearly 47 compared with men who had bmi of between 18 5 and 20 at the time of conscription men with bmi of 20 to 22 5 had 22 increased risk of heart failure after adjusting for factors that could affect the results the risk nearly doubled for those with bmi between 22 5 and 25 and more than tripled for those with bmi between 25 and 27 5 the risk increased more than six fold for those classified as obese with bmi between 30 35 and was nearly 10 fold for the very obese with bmi of 35 or more the researchers say their findings suggest that preventive action needs to be taken earlier in life prof rosengren said current prevention guidelines are meant to guide doctors treating patients with factors that may put them at increased risk of heart and blood vessel problems within the next decade or so the overwhelming majority of young people have an extremely low risk of any such problems and so are not in need of preventive measures on an individual basis except for firm anti smoking advice however our findings show the importance of body weight in adolescence and suggest that more emphasis should be placed on the maintenance of healthy body weight from an early age as preventive measure the researchers point out that limitations to the study include the fact that their findings are only applicable to men and that overall women have lower risk of heart failure than men nor did they have any information on weight gain after the men were conscripted at 18 so that slightly greater weight at 18 might be an indicator of an increased risk of subsequently becoming overweight or obese which in itself would be risk factor for heart

1372,history had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient today referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations as you are well aware he is pleasant 64 year old gentleman who unfortunately is suffering from end stage copd who required tracheostomy tube placement about three months ago when being treated for acute exacerbation of copd and having difficulty coming off ventilatory support he now resides in an extended care facility with capped tracheostomy tube and he unfortunately states he has had not had to use the tracheostomy tube since his discharge and admission to the extended care facility he requires constant oxygen administration and has been having no problems with shortness of breath worsening requiring opening the tracheostomy tube site he states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck no history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion past medical history copd history of hypercarbic hypoxemia history of coronary artery disease history of previous myocardial infarction and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use past surgical history tonsillectomy adenoidectomy cholecystectomy appendectomy hernia repair and tracheostomy family history strong for heart disease coronary artery disease hypertension diabetes mellitus

signs age 64 blood pressure is 110 78 pulse 96 and temperature is 98 6 general the patient was examined in his wheelchair resting comfortably in no acute distress head normocephalic no masses or lesions noted face no facial tenderness or asymmetry noted eyes pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally extraocular movements are intact bilaterally ears the tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with good light reflex the external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted weber and rinne tests are within normal limits nose the nasal cavities are patent bilaterally the nasal septum is midline there are no nasal discharges no masses or lesions noted throat the oral mucosa appears healthy dental hygiene is maintained well no oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted no postnasal drip noted neck the patient has stable appearing tracheostomy tube site and the stoma appears to be without signs of infection the previous incision was vertical in nature and there is no hypertrophic scar formation no adenopathy noted no stridor noted neurologic cranial nerve vii intact bilaterally no signs of tremor lungs diminished breath sounds in all four quadrants no wheezes noted heart regular rate and rhythm procedure limited bronchoscopy and then fiberoptic laryngoscopy impression 1 end stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with history of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support with tracheostomy tube placement 2 difficulty tolerating tracheostomy tubes secondary to swallow discomfort and neck irritation with no further need for tracheostomy tube over the past few months with the patient tolerating capped tracheostomy tube 24 hours day 3 history of coronary artery disease 4 history of myocardial infarction 5 history of cirrhosis of liver recommendations discussed with the patient in detail after fiberoptic laryngoscopy and limited bronchoscopy was performed in the office whether or not to pull out the tracheostomy tube his vocal cords moved well and do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region and felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility did impress the fact that believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support which could include intubation and if the intubation is prolonged tracheostomy may be needed creation of long term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such long tracheostomy tube and informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time the patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone but wishes to have it removed and did remove it today dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly ,yes

restrictive lung diseases respiratory tract infections trachea bronchi bronchioles alveoli the nerves and muscles breathing etc pulmonary vascular disease pulmonary veno occlusive disease pulmonary vascular disease is defined as condition of blood flow to the lung artery is blocked suddenly due to blood clot somewhere in the body including pulmonary embolism chronic thromboembolic disease pulmonary arterial hypertension pulmonary veno occlusive disease pulmonary arteriovenous malformations pulmonary edema etc pulmonary veno occlusive disease pvod is an extremely rare form of pulmonary hypertension affecting mostly in children and young adults as result of progressive obstruction of small pulmonary veins that leads to elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure the diagnosis patients in the early stage with early pulmonary veno occlusive disease pvod may experience no symptoms at all but the progression of diseasse may attributable to pulmonary hypertension and right sided heart failure supervene 32 1 noninvasive diagnosis to detect pvod 33 noninvasive diagnostic approach may include 1 chest high resolution computed tomographymay be helpful for clinical differential diagnosis of pvod and pch in the study to examine chest hrct images for four patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ipah three patients with pvod and three patients with pch and to evaluate pulmonary vascular casts of lung tissues obtained from those patients at lung transplantation or autopsy found that measurement of the sizes of centrilobular ggos in hrct is simple and useful method for clinical differential diagnosis of pvod and pch 34 2 arterial blood gas analysis abg the aim of the blood withdrawn from an artery involving puncturing an artery with thin needle and syringe is to determine the ph of the blood the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen the bicarbonate level and gas exchange which reflect gas exchange across the alveolar capillary membrane 35 3 pulmonary function tests pft it is complete evaluation of the respiratory system including patient history physical examinations chest ray examinations arterial blood gas analysis and tests of pulmonary function 36 4 bronchoalveolar lavage bronchoalveolar lavage has well established role in the diagnosis of pulmonary infections particularly those due to opportunistic organisms in an immunocompromised host with an aim to assess number of pulmonary components of whchi may be useful in this regard particularly if combined with new methods for examining inflammatory responses such as those utilising the polymerase chain reaction to assess cellular expression for inflammatory cytokines and growth factors 37 5 transthoracic echocardiography transthoracic echocardiography is an important initial non invasive diagnostic tool with aim to evaluate patients in whom pulmonary hypertension is suspected according to the accf aha 2009 expert consensus document on pulmonary hypertension 38 6 flow cytometry pulmonary arterial hypertension pah and pulmonary veno occlusive disease pvod both display occlusive remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature responsible for increased pulmonary vascular resistances cytotoxic ctl natural killer nk and natural killer nkt cells play critical role in vascular remodeling in different physiological and pathological conditions according to study decrease in gnly demethylation in the gdna extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and explanted lungs was found specifically in pvod but not in pah this was associated with decrease in populations and subpopulations of ctl and nkt and an increase of nk populations despite the reduced granulysin containing cells in patients with pvod gnly serum levels were higher suggesting these cells were wasting their content furthermore the increase of gnly concentration in the serum of pvod was significantly higher than in patients with pah 39 2 surgical biopsy since surgical biopsy represents high risk procedure in these patients it is contraindicated lung biopsy or pathologic examination of pulmonary explants or postmortem lung samples however lung biopsy is hazardous in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and there is need for noninvasive diagnostic tools in this patient population patients with pvod may be refractory to pulmonary arterial hypertension pah specific therapy and may even deteriorate with it it is important to identify such patients as soon as possible because they should be treated cautiously and considered for lung

1384,i woke up yesterday morning feeling vaguely depressed but until my husband nick wished me happy birthday didn realize this was the day turn 75 years old think was dreading this birthday partly because my mother died at 74 her birth day was feb 3 1911 mine is feb 4 1941 my mother died of congestive heart failure and actually outlived her doctors predictions by about year so drank my morning coffee and tried to sort out the jumble of thoughts and emotions this 75th birthday so close to the beginning of new year was definitely for me liminal experience as daughter eleni would call it limen means threshold in latin eleni studied anthropology in college and in her blog the liminal stage she explains liminal stages are psychological thresholds times of transition when we stand betwixt and between one state and another the biggies are birth marriage death cultures develop splashy rituals around these transitions to ease the anxiety they provoke you can guess which liminal stage was contemplating in fact ve been talking so much about death in recent months that my kids and husband keep razzing me about it ve sent them memos about what want and don want at my funeral no open coffin in fact no body or casket funeral service for immediate family only some time later party open house memorial service with no eulogies only extemporaneous anecdotes with lots of food wine and music ve already worked out the entire mix of songs want heavy on led zeppelin and queen before her death my mother the world most organized person had written down the hymns and scripture readings for her funeral specified cremation and purchased the mausoleum niche where her ashes and my father would be stowed in brass boxes that resemble books she chose niche which had view of the swans on the cemetery pond she had all their financial affairs in order filed neatly in her desk when she died my father on the other hand had dementia as well as parkinson disease until he died at 80 so he didn even known when my mother died his dementia first became evident at our parents fiftieth wedding anniversary in 1982 when he was about 76 needless to say ve been watching myself for signs of alzheimer and avidly doing lumosity brain games every day daughter marina kindly signed me up knowing my worry about memory loss realize as recent articles have pointed out that lumosity doesn really help you stave off dementia it just measures how you become better at the games with practice but nevertheless it gave me comfort that yesterday workout results put me at 91 3 lpi whatever that is as compared with my age group and 97 3 for problem solving but only 81 9 for memory was happy that my numbers had gone up but then realized that overnight the age group was being compared to had changed from age 70 to 74 to over 75 less competition for the past fifty years or so ve been making pretty much the same new year resolutions as everyone else lose ten pounds go to the gym or pilates twice week publish book with my own name on it learn spanish so can communicate better with my bilingual grandchildren this year my new year resolutions changed m no longer interested in improving my weight career or possessions but still want to learn spanish all my resolutions can be collected under the theme get rid of stuff am hoarder as my family will attest even bought the best seller the life changing magic of tidying up by marie kondo but after reading several chapters had to stop because it was making me feel so guilty now m going to target certain areas my studio my computer desk my make up area the library and especially my closets one at time tons of papers have to go all those books ll never read again will be donated to the grafton library for sale all my office appropriate clothes will go to dress for success so that other younger women can find jobs ve told the kids whatever they want take it now in hopes of avoiding as among my mother nine siblings bitter schisms between two children who want the same antique bureau as the day of my 75th birthday moved from morose reflections over coffee to astonishment at the sight of over 200 birthday wishes on the internet alternated between tears over the card my husband gave me and laughter for instance when daughter eleni posted on facebook did you know that on her 60th birthday witnessed this woman sip from hash milkshake in amsterdam trust me she was in it for the milkshake happy birthday party girl was delighted to receive calls and gifts from son chris and daughter marina both on the opposite side of the country and chuckled at the books marina sent the alzheimer prevention program keep your brain alive and 41 uses for grandma among them at the end of the day at dinner in the romantic restaurant casa tua in south beach fl nick and told each other how lucky we are that we ve made it through 45 years of marriage that we have three great kids and two extraordinary grandchildren and that when we get up in the morning no parts of our bodies hurt that a rare blessing when your age group is over 75 so by the time the waiter brought birthday cr me brul with candle in it as well as chocolate meltdown both surprises ordered by daughter eleni felt ready to cross the threshold into the next liminal stage whatever it brings ,no

1405,breakthrough cholesterol drugs fizzle amid price pushback the associated press posted 04 20 2016 06 09 27 pm edt updated 04 20 2016 06 09 27 pm edt washington gt gt when powerful pair of cholesterol lowering drugs first hit the market last summer initial excitement in the medical community quickly turned to panic the new drugs promised to reduce artery clogging cholesterol by nearly twice as much as older ones but they came at an eye popping price more than 14 000 per year compared with roughly 150 for the standard drugs some experts predicted doomsday scenario in which the two injectable drugs repatha and praluent would add staggering 100 billion to the s drug bill as doctors signed up millions of patients with elevated cholesterol but then something unexpected happened not much caught between skeptical doctors and cost conscious insurers the drugs have barely sold sanofi reported meager 10 million from praluent in the last quarter which it co markets with regeneron pharmaceuticals amgen inc declined to break out repatha sales spending on pricey specialty drugs has doubled over the last five years to 150 billion contributing 70 percent of the growth in s medication spending since 2010 according to ims health but the startlingly slow launch of praluent and repatha suggests insurers may have found their own formula for fighting back proof of effectiveness requirements and rigorous paperwork that limits how many patients ultimately receive high cost drugs experts see an escalating feud between drugmakers and insurers with little relief in sight advertisement the companies think that their drug is going to save lot of lives and payers tend to be skeptical of those claims somewhere in the middle is the truth says professor darius lakdawalla of the university of southern california generally speaking insurers only cover the costs of the new drugs for patients with extremely high cholesterol caused by genetic disorders or those with history of heart problems and elevated cholesterol the insurance paperwork can run several pages and often requires detailed history of past treatments caught in the middle of the coverage fight are patients who say they desperately need more options to control bad cholesterol or ldl christian jacobs 24 takes eight medications to manage his cholesterol and related complications including blood thinners for the seven artery opening stents he received since 2011 he has rare form of inheritable cholesterol that occurs in roughly one in million people so he was shocked when his insurance provider unitedhealth rejected his doctors prescription for repatha was floored he said how in the world can we be rejected for medication that meet every single standard for jacobs said unitedhealth recommended he continue his current drug regimen to see if it lowers his cholesterol he is appealing the decision unitedhealth which declined to comment on jacobs situation due to patient privacy laws said in statement it uses clinical guidelines and scientific evidence when making coverage decisions these new therapies offer additional ldl cholesterol lowering and outcomes studies are still pending said the firm recent medical history is littered with once promising drugs that lowered test results like cholesterol yet failed to actually help patients considering the high prices and limited data many doctors favor go slow approach if you re going to spend that kind of money on medication then you need to know that it really doing something said dr hal chadow of brookdale university hospital chadow has successfully prescribed the drugs to several high risk patients but he wants to see more research before using them more broadly some of the nation top cardiologists predict the drugs will eventually reduce heart attack rates far below levels currently seen with statin pills the standard of care for high cholesterol since the 1990s but studies confirming those benefits are still months away key reason insurers demand extensive documentation before reimbursing the drugs really think it a disservice to the public health to put people in charge of this who are essentially bean counters said dr steven nissen of the cleveland clinic the medical center has assigned an expert to coach doctors on completing the insurance paperwork industry figures suggest high bar 90 percent of claims for repatha and praluent were initially rejected in the last quarter of 2015 according symphony health firm that analyzes insurance data the companies doing the rejecting say they are merely following prescribing instructions on the medicines which are approved by the food and drug administration dr steve miller of express scripts the largest pharmacy benefit manager says the company is approving more claims as doctors get better at picking the right patients and making sure they have adequate supporting data wall street continues to bet that the drugs known as pcsk9 inhibitors will become blockbusters eventually while many have slashed short term estimates most analysts predict that repatha and praluent will generate combined annual sales of over 5 billion by 2020 according to polling by evaluate pharma drugs that generate 1 billion or more annually are considered blockbusters the analyst projections depend on one key assumption that follow up studies show the drugs reduce heart attacks and death amgen is expected to unveil data from its pivotal study later this year with similar study from sanofi next year but even assuming those studies pan out some experts say the drugs which are self injected once or twice month depending on the medication and indication are still overpriced one analysis concluded that pcsk9 drugs represent low value for patients and said fairer price would be roughly half the list price or between 5 000 and 8 000 per year according to the institute for clinical and economic review sanofi and amgen each criticized the group analysis disagreeing with its methods and conclusions the boston nonprofit receives funding from foundations insurers drugmakers and academic institutions dr steven pearson the group president says new approaches are needed for pricing medicines based on performance he points to another pricey drug launched last summer novartis heart failure drug entresto has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and death more than older drugs but its 4 600 annual price has slowed uptake novartis has signed unusual pay for performance contracts with several insurers offering partial refunds if the drug fails to deliver better outcomes pearson group gave the drug positive marks in an evaluation last year we came out saying good evidence on clinical effectiveness and good value in november amgen announced similar agreement with harvard pilgrim health care system if repatha doesn lower patients cholesterol to levels seen in company trials harvard pilgrim gets rebate that approach is already used in europe and could become more common here think payers really are interested in working with manufacturers to find way out of the cul de sac in which they find themselves pearson said

subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea operation performed neck exploration tracheostomy urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site removal of foreign body tracheal metallic stent material dilation distal trachea placement of 8 shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube indications for surgery the patient is 50 year old white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the national tennessee and several years ago he had tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement however developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement subsequently he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the abc hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on month dd yyyy he underwent bronchoscopy by dr and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes the patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and laryngology and thoracic surgery services were consulted for further management exploration of trachea removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding infection alteration of voice speech swallowing voice changes permanently possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway loss of voice cardiac risk factors anesthetic risks recurrence of problems upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length the patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed description of procedure the patient was taken to the operating room placed in the supine position following adequate monitoring by anesthesia service to maintain sedation the patient neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion the neck was then infiltrated with 1 xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle this was an outline incision was carried out the skin subcutaneous tissue platysma subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly strap muscles were separated in the midline dissection carried down to visceral fascia beneath the strap muscles there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks there appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable there was markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation attachment of the thyroid isthmus fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest the trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation the tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness the trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted the patient however was able to ventilate at this point 6 endo tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered once the airway was secured we then proceeded working around the 6 endo tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis after removal of the stents and granulation tissue the upper trachea was widely patent the mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation stent material was removed from this area as well in the distal third of the trachea third stent was embedded within the mucosa not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time all visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed initial attempt to place 16 montgomery tube showed the distal lumen of the tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third also this was removed and 8 shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa the distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent this secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3 0 vicryl the skin

1435,i was readmitted to the hospital when my 4th baby was 6 days old and was in full blown congestive heart failure it was super scary and no one could figure out why it happened lost 17 pounds of fluids in 25 hours in the hospital thankfully recovered without any damage about 3 months later started having joint pain having 4 kids ages 5 and under ignored it and went on with my life assuming it was my hormones normalizing after delivery then went on vacation for week with my mom and she was shocked at my limping and being unable to open things every day she insisted she would take me to the doctor when we got home so the following week made an appt and my mom literally picked me up from my house and took me to the doctor to make sure would go the doc agreed that it was likely just hormone related after pregnancy by ordered labs and my rf factor came back high then saw rheumatologist and still wasn convinced that everything else was ruled out so before starting the methotrexate waited to get second opinion from harvard trained rheumatologist in miami he ordered ton of more blood work but in the end agreed with the diagnosis and the starting methotrexate and so that is what did that was almost 4 years ago took my first dose of enbrel 5 days ago and may feel little improved today won believe it till it continues but your story gives me hope thank you ,yes

1437,it a familiar feeling for any caffeine addict racing heart fluttering away after one too many espresso shots for years that been enough to steer people with certain heart conditions away from coffee but as it turns out there little evidence that caffeine habit could send us into cardiac arrest that according to dr greg marcus professor at the university of california san francisco and this week guest on the inquiring minds podcast marcus specializes in the treatment of arrhythmias or irregular heartbeats the fast sluggish or off kilter rhythms that can trigger sudden cardiac arrest an unexpected loss of heart function the condition is different from heart attack which is caused by blockages to blood vessels leading to the heart and it has seen comparatively little progress in treatment and prevention marcus says in the united states sudden cardiac arrest kills 325 000 adults each year last year marcus research team looked into the relationship between caffeine and type of arrhythmia called early beats which can be risk factor for developing heart failure you can think of this condition as individual heart cells gone rogue if you take heart cell out of the heart put it in petri dish and keep it alive it will beat on its own marcus tells co host kishore hari sometimes those cells will jump the gun beating little earlier than the rest of the heart there this conventional wisdom that more caffeine leads to these early beats marcus says to find out if that really the case his the team monitored heart rhythms along with consumption of common caffeine fixes such as tea coffee and chocolate what they discovered might surprise you we could find no evidence of relationship says marcus the results were published in the journal of the american heart association still marcus cautions that the heart risks of caffeine may depend on the individual and that more work needs to be done to unpack the role of patient unique genetics and environmental exposures this ties into broader need for more precision medicine he says highly personalized treatments that take those specific factors into account the hope is that with modern techniques to sequence genes as well as to potentially monitor activity using technology maybe we can really get down to that level he says cue health eheart pioneering big data approach to develop strategies to prevent and treat all aspects of heart disease the goal of the project is to use personal technology to free large scale clinical research from its traditional home in brick and mortar hospitals where researchers capture controlled artificial snapshot of participants health and behaviors by gathering information from online surveys and personal gadgets anything from smartphones to bluetooth enabled blood pressure cuffs marcus team at ucsf is able to study continuous stream of health data as participants go about their daily activities that what like to call real time real life data he says participants are given the option to get involved in variety of studies depending on their backgrounds and the devices they use owners of smart watch for example might be asked to opt into an ongoing study on atrial fibrillation an irregular beat in the heart upper chambers that an important risk factor for stroke the study attempts to develop more nuanced understanding of what triggers the condition making use of the watch heart rate monitor to interlace rhythmic data with other instantaneous measures of health and physical activity while the health eheart project aims to unpack the individualized factors that carry risk for heart disease marcus also hopes it will play more foundational role for further research separating the wheat from the chaff as he puts it by helping to figure out whether wearable devices are as beneficial to public health research as their makers chalk them up to be fitbit and the apple watch are examples he says of devices with savvy health and fitness marketing but still untested claims is it useful for health we make that assumption but how valid is it and if it is valid what is the best way to use it ucsf hopes to enroll 1 million people

1453,what is the kingdom of god where is the kingdom of god is the kingdom of god just another word or synonym in the gospels for heaven the kingdom of god sparks many questions and rightly so when searching the gospels for kingdom of god or kingdom of heaven which appears more often in the gospel according to saint matthew one is amazed by the numerous references throughout the centuries believers have pondered the meaning and implications of the kingdom of god and scholars certainly have grappled with the phrase and filled library shelves with volumes of thought provoking commentaries what can and must we do with the reality of the kingdom in our day in 1975 pope paul vi penned the apostolic exhortation evangelii nuntiandi on evangelizing in our day early in the exhortation the bishop of rome states as an evangelizer christ first of all proclaims kingdom the kingdom of god and this is so important that by comparison everything else becomes the rest which is given in addition only the kingdom therefore is absolute and it makes everything else relative the lord will delight in describing in many ways the happiness of belonging to this kingdom paradoxical happiness which is made up of things that the world rejects the demands of the kingdom and its magna charta the heralds of the kingdom its mysteries its children the vigilance and fidelity demanded of whoever awaits its definitive coming evangelii nuntiandi 8 clearly pope paul vi sees the kingdom of god has the central experience of jesus public ministry so central that everything in his ministry is grounded in the kingdom similarly the catechism of the catholic church paragraphs 541 through 556 examines the manifold depth of the kingdom in jesus public ministry based on these texts as well as other catechetical documents the roman missal and the sacred scriptures have compiled working description note not definition of the kingdom of god that has been helpful to undergraduates deacon candidates seminarians and believers there is certainly much room for discussion in this description and is in no way intended to be exhaustive 1 the kingdom of god is god our father intervening definitively in the created order the kingdom is not necessarily or strictly specific place although place will be dimension of the kingdom as way of living the kingdom is way of living an ongoing activity initiated by god the father in loving concern for beings that have been created in his image and likeness we have become addicted to sin in such way that we cannot break free from its grip by our own power we have come to enjoy sin too much sin tentacles have woven deeply into our lives that often we cannot see or think clearly we may from time to time have great desires to rid ourselves of sin desires that are marvelous but desires that do not contain within themselves the power to effect what is desired more often than not however sin has dulled our senses to divine love sin has numbed us into complacency and entitlement to the point that we even approach the things of god and church from selfish point of view with no regard to the life of faith as engagement with the divine persons who call me as an individual and as community to ongoing conversion manifesting charity and service to the body of christ so powerless over sin so addicted to the false self we have become that an intervention is needed the kingdom of god 2 this intervention is work of power power that transforms and surpasses the power of creation god the father work is quintessentially work of restoration not annihilation ask anyone in construction and he or she will tell you that it is often easier to raze building and start over than to renovate or restore renovating an existing structure that does not have level plumb or square line in it makes restoration tedious and time consuming not to mention the surprises lurking behind old plaster and lathe yet ask any restorer when the project is complete and most likely she or he will tell you that in spite of its challenges and frustrations it was and continues to be labor of love such is the kingdom neither creation nor humanity is destroyed the creator does not raze the created order and begin anew even though humanity makes continuous choices reinforcing the addiction to sin the father with eyes of loves gazes upon each human person in such way that each of us are declared precious so precious are we in the sight of god the father that none of us are disposable expendable or useless each of us has particular vocation in the father plan of salvation and our very being is so precious to the father that the loving transforming power of his kingdom calls us from the addiction to our false selves to our true selves as icons of the father love 3 this transforming power becomes way of living hence not specific place that one can absolutely pinpoint you cannot use google maps or gps device to find the kingdom the kingdom is god the father way of living it is way of living that is the son jesus he lives each moment of his life attentive to his father word and will spending nights in communion with his father jesus teaches with his life that kingdom living is living joined connected related whatever words you wish to use to god the father as way of living the kingdom is radical embrace of the first commandment no one nor no thing nor anything we deem important comes before the father or interferes with our relationship with him kingdom living is life that provides the essentials to sister or brother in need matthew 25 and celebrates praise and thanks the father for all that he is doing in life cf luke 1 the magnificat it is in this sense that one can speak of the kingdom as place wherever one is when living as the father commands there is the kingdom 4 the kingdom as way of living has been prepared by the prophets of old many of the prophets called israel to authentic worship message that is still quite valid despite present misguided and weak arguments that attempt erroneously at division between religion and spirituality for the prophets the spiritual relationship formed by the covenant necessarily bound one religion freely to observe and practice continuous ongoing change of heart the prophets knew that the energy required to live justly as covenant person did not come from within person by himself or herself such living depended upon the mercy of god celebrated and experienced in authentic worship such worship then propelled one to be an instrument of charitable service in the world acting not on one own initiative and power in the name of god 5 the kingdom as way of living is now definitely revealed and embodied in jesus here all ambiguity concerning the kingdom is erased the kingdom is essentially person the person jesus only he can lead us to the love of the father in the spirit and make us share in the life of the holy trinity catechism of the catholic church paragraph 426 the incarnation makes the kingdom reality in the created order to effect the father loving transformation of everything most especially the human heart responding and living the love revealed to us in christ jesus is the essential work and live of the kingdom of god is there more to be said about the kingdom certainly but more importantly the kingdom is not intended for study but for living while some of these reflections may give us some insight such insight is always directed to worshipping god the father and serving one another in the name of jesus christ with the gifts and power of the holy spirit as jesus teaching on prayer is proclaimed today at mass consider have thought that the kingdom of god is what does it mean to seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness in view of the kingdom of god am thankful for glory to the father and to the son and to the holy spirit as it was in the beginning is now and will be forever amen top,no

since paul was taken my ambulance to mercy hospital er with his heart pounding erratically and two weeks to the day that he was released from the hospital after having catheter ablation to correct atrial flutter click on this link to read that story it been an up and down journey since paul had procedural followup appointment monday of this week between the ablation and this appointment he had couple of bad spells although nothing even remotely close to that which took him to the er in the first place but concerning nonetheless we learned from craig hoffman the physician assistant who saw paul that flutter ablation is about 95 to 98 effective naturally we re hoping that paul isn in the 3 to 5 for whom it ineffective if the flutter procedure has been successful then what he experiencing when his heart is misbehaving is probably atrial fibrillation but he on medication for that so after thorough discussion we collectively decided paul should wear heart monitor for couple of days to make sure there no flutter and see how frequent and how severe the fibrillation is we learned however that there a third component in the mix sleep apnea also know as obstructive sleep apnea wow was ever ignorant about this condition previously thought well sure you don want to stop breathing altogether when you re sleeping but if it just little pause that always passes no harm no foul wrong at the bottom ve included an article from the national institutes of health national heart lund and blood institute explaining what sleep apnea is and the dangers it poses so paul is going to have sleep study done in the next few weeks we ll figure out what to do from there what is sleep apnea sleep apnea is common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep breathing pauses can last from few seconds to minutes they may occur 30 times or more an hour typically normal breathing then starts again sometimes with loud snort or choking sound sleep apnea usually is chronic ongoing condition that disrupts your sleep when your breathing pauses or becomes shallow you ll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep as result the quality of your sleep is poor which makes you tired during the day sleep apnea is leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness overview sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed doctors usually can detect the condition during routine office visits also no blood test can help diagnose the condition most people who have sleep apnea don know they have it because it only occurs during sleep family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea the most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea in this condition the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep this causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses when you try to breathe any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight but it can affect anyone for example small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea central sleep apnea is less common type of sleep apnea this disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn send the correct signals to your breathing muscles as result you ll make no effort to breathe for brief periods central sleep apnea can affect anyone however it more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone snoring typically doesn happen with central sleep apnea this article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea untreated sleep apnea can increase the risk of high blood pressure heart attack stroke obesity and diabetes increase the risk of or worsen heart failure make arrhythmias ah rith me ahs or irregular heartbeats more likely increase the chance of having work related or driving accidents note from me other research indicates that sleep apnea can also damage the brain the below excerpt is from the sleep foundation researchers have found yet another reason why people with obstructive sleep apnea osa should get tested and treated for the disease according to recent study published in the journal sleep patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome demonstrated reduced brain gray matter concentration gray matter refers to the cerebral cortex where most information processing in the brain takes place and here from webmd is how osa causes or is correlated to increased risks here are seven health problems you might face if you have osa 1 high blood pressure if you already have it obstructive sleep apnea can make it worse waking up often during the night can cause your hormone systems to go into overdrive which boosts your blood pressure levels when you can breathe well in your sleep the level of oxygen in your blood drops which may add to the problem treatment does make difference though some people with high bp who get help for sleep apnea can cut back on their blood pressure medications 2 heart disease people with osa are more likely to have heart attacks the causes may be low oxygen or the stress of waking up often stroke and atrial fibrillation problem with the rhythm of your heartbeat are also linked with the condition sleep apnea disrupts how your body takes in oxygen which makes it hard for your brain to control how blood flows in your arteries and the brain itself 3 type 2 diabetes sleep apnea is common among people with this condition up to 80 of them have osa obesity raises person risk for both disorders although studies haven shown clear link between sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes not getting enough shut eye can keep your body from using insulin properly which leads to diabetes 4 weight gain extra pounds raise your chances of getting sleep apnea and the condition also makes it harder to slim down when you re overweight you can have fatty deposits in your neck that block breathing at night on the flip side sleep apnea can make your body release more of the hormone ghrelin which makes you crave carbs and sweets and when you re tired all the time you might not be able to turn the food you eat into energy as efficiently which can lead to weight gain 2 heart disease people with osa are more likely to have heart attacks the

treatment may find they have fewer asthma attacks 6 acid reflux there no proof that sleep apnea causes this kind of heartburn that doesn get better but many people say that it a problem treating it seems to improve apnea symptoms sleep doctors say 7 car accidents when you feel groggy that can raise your risk of falling asleep at the wheel people with sleep apnea are up to five times more likely than normal sleepers to have traffic accidents ,no

1457,clinical pharmacists in health care teams may improve quality safety of patient care published on april 6 2016 at 3 59 pm no comments problems related to elderly patients medical drug treatments are widespread and commonly result in hospital admissions for people with dementia new research shows that including clinical pharmacists in health care teams might improve the quality and safety of patient care and halve the risk of drug related hospital readmissions this according to dissertation at umea university in sweden doctoral student and clinical pharmacist maria gustafsson at the department of community medicine and rehabilitation at umea university has carried out randomised controlled trial in the northern swedish county sterbotten among 460 people from 65 years and above suffering from dementia or cognitive impairment the participants had at some point between 2012 and 2015 been admitted to internal medicine and orthopaedic wards at two hospitals in northern sweden when analysing all patient causes of the original admission before the study intervention was performed we found that as many as 41 per cent of all admissions were related to medication events the most common problem is adverse drug reaction but also excessively high dosage and noncompliance is unfortunately common says maria gustafsson related stories measuring brain signal variability could help identify patients at higher risk of dementia the study was based on an intervention where clinical pharmacists participated in health care teams and controlled if individual patients drug lists were correct and complete they also performed comprehensive analyses of all the drugs patient was taking and suggested potential improvements to the physician in charge as well as initiated discussions in the health care team the results after the intervention showed that clinical pharmacists participation in health care teams reduced the risk of drug related hospital readmissions by half during the follow up time of 180 days says maria gustafsson in patient groups with heart failure no effect of the pharmacist intervention was observed for the group as whole the intervention also reduced the risk of early drug related hospital readmissions e those within 30 days the study also showed that antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs were common among people with dementia in specialised care units the drugs were also used for long periods of time which is inconsistent with prevailing treatment guidelines according to the study there is link between several behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia such as aggressive behaviour and widespread prescribing of antipsychotics and other psychotropic substances this indicates that psychotropics are sometimes used to treat symptoms among people with dementia despite known risks of adverse effects and limited research evidence supporting the treatment efficacy drug treatment related problems in elderly people with dementia are very common and more work is needed in order to prevent identify and treat these problems in this part of the population says maria gustafsson source ,no

lumen tube operative procedure in detail after obtaining informed consent from the patient including thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered prior to administration of general anesthesia the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed in addition he had dual lumen endotracheal tube placed the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after applying sterile dressings 10 blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery the abdomen was opened next balfour retractor was positioned as well as mechanical retractor next our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach in an attempt to do so we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2 0 silk we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2 0 silk next we turned our attention to performing kocher maneuver this was done and the stomach was freed up we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest we also did portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2 0 stick tie reinforcement at this point the stomach was freely mobile we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube 2 0 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site we placed 16 french red rubber catheter through this site we tied down in place we then used 3 0 silk sutures to perform witzel next the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2 0 silk ties after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately we turned our attention to closing the abdomen this was done with 1 prolene we put in 2nd layer of 2 0 vicryl the skin was closed with 4 0 monocryl next we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position the right chest was prepped and draped appropriately we then used 10 blade scalpel to make an incision in posterolateral non muscle sparing fashion dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery next the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered the lung was deflated we placed standard chest retractors next we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein the azygos vein in fact was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2 0 stick ties as mentioned we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus after doing this we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring we used an automatic pursestring and applied we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors we secured our pursestring and then placed 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty next we tabularized our stomach using 80 gia stapler after doing so we chose portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall we connected our anvil to the eea stapler this was then secured appropriately we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition we then fired the stapler we obtained 2 complete rings 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach which were sent for pathology we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening this was closed with 2 0 vicryl in running fashion we then buttressed this with serosal 3 0 vicryl interrupted sutures we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it next we placed two 28 french chest tubes 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly taking care not to place it near the anastomosis we then closed the chest with 2 vicryl in an interrupted figure of eight fashion the lung was brought up we closed the muscle layers with 0 vicryl followed by 0 vicryl then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2 0 vicryl and the skin with 4 0 monocryl sterile dressing was applied the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the icu in good condition ,yes

1471,if you have problem with stress and keep putting off learning how to deal with it in healthy way you may be making it easier for cancer to spread throughout your body researchers have found that when mice are exposed to chronic ongoing stress their lymphatic systems undergo physical changes that make it quicker and easier for cancer to spread throughout their bodies and if you have cancer stress is an understatement doctors have drug that seems to stop this activity and are testing it now on breast cancer patients but seeing how stress physically helps tumors progress should be big wake up call about how strongly stress may impact other diseases or areas of your health scientists already knew that stress hormones could increase blood vessel formation giving cancerous cells more potential escape routes but until now it wasn clear whether they also influenced the lymphatic system to test that theory mice were restrained to create stress the researchers found that the stressed out mice had higher rate of cancer spreading than their relaxed peers and were able to show that this was because the stress hormone adrenaline was activating the sympathetic nervous system sns to amp up the rate of lymph formation not only that the stress hormone actually physically changed the lymph vessels draining out of tumours allowing cancerous cells to escape to other parts of the body faster so not only do you get new freeways out of the tumor but the speed limit is increased and so the tumor cells can flow out of the tumor much more rapidly said erica sloan from monash university in australia the drug that holds promise at slowing spread of cancer from stress is beta blocker known as propranolol when tracked over about seven years it turned out that those that had been taking beta blockers also showed far less evidence of tumor cells moving into the lymph nodes and then disseminating to other organs like the lung so it provides clinical support for what we see in the mice sloan told abc there are concerns that some beta blockers can cause and worsen heart problems even congestive heart failure 1 decision to use this medication would need to be carefully considered by patient and doctor healthy ways to handle stress because we are learning more about the physical affects of stress on disease health and our bodies through research it may be time to change how we perceive stress for many people it a minor annoyance for others like those suffering with cancer it a huge burden and learning how to handle stress in healthier way is best done when it doesn have such stronghold on you breathing exercises have been used for centuries by indian yogis to calm the mind relax the body and restore health adopting this daily practice that just takes minutes day could have positive health benefits that extend from peace of mind to possibly disease preventing to learn more about using this breathing technique to improve your health click here for demonstration video 1 http www uptodate com contents major side effects of beta blockers the post control stress control cancer appeared first on easy health options ,no

1475,it been big week here in the uk this week george osborne dropped the uk federal budget it got some interesting points and one headline and vote grabbing new measure if the uk budget is anything to go by and it is then the aussie budget in couple of months time could be just as big whatever happens in the upcoming aussie budget my take is they ll follow suit with the uk most talked about new tax the sugar tax first things first let quickly recap why the sugar tax is even thing the world health organisation who regards childhood obesity as one of the most serious and significant global challenges of the 21st century their concerns are just in the uk the national child measurement program ncmp measures the height and weight of around one million schoolkids every year their 2014 15 results were truly shocking approximately 19 1 of children aged 10 11 were obese around 14 2 were overweight for kids aged 4 5 9 1 were obese and 12 8 overweight in the uk around one in three kids are obese or overweight the australian institute of health and welfare report that 25 of australian children are obese or overweight they rate it as higher burden of disease than smoking this is problem everywhere who do you blame the food industry my view on the childhood obesity epidemic is pretty black and white and sometimes unpopular if you underfeed your kid it child abuse if you overfeed them it the same there no two ways about it as parents you are responsible for the health and safety of your kids there no question that childhood obesity is global problem long term it a significant issue for government welfare and healthcare systems the university of maryland medical centre lists the side effects of obesity type 2 diabetes high blood pressure coronary artery disease high cholesterol high levels of fat in the blood heart failure respiratory problems now imagine whole generation of kids living with this in life it will result in death far earlier than necessary it will also result in incredible strain on healthcare systems the independent reports that in the uk the bill for obesity related illnesses reaches 5 1bn year the journal of occupational and environmental medicine highlights compared to nonsmokers average health costs were 1 275 higher for smokers the incremental costs associated with obesity were even higher 1 850 more than for normal weight individuals for those with morbid obesity the excess costs were up to 5 500 per year it all just as bad in australia the national health and medical research council states 2009 report by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that there will be continued increases in overweight and obesity levels across all age groups during the next decade in australia to around 66 of the population they go on to explain that data from the australian diabetes obesity and lifestyle ausdiab study indicate that the total direct cost for overweight and obesity in 2005 was 21 billion 6 5 billion for overweight and 14 5 billion for obesity the same study estimated indirect costs of 35 6 billion per year resulting in an overall total annual cost of 56 6 billion colagiuri et al 2010 the world is getting fat kids are getting fat parents are getting fat this fat epidemic is killing us and killing economies someone needs to put stop to it but who who do you blame who the scapegoat here where the easy out taking the easy route arguments are this is an industry problem if food and beverage industries didn pack so much sugar into food and drink the problem wouldn be as bad this line of argument has led the british government to world first sugar tax the tax will come in from 2018 and any soft drink with more than five grams of sugar per 100ml is in trouble the bbc reports that the office for budgetary responsibility suggests the levy will add 18p au 0 34 or 24p au 0 45 per litre or about 6p au 0 11 or 8p au 0 15 to standard 330ml can that means for red bull pepsi or coke around 11p au 0 20 per can will be added to the price this is serious tax generation policy for the uk estimates are it will raise 550 million au 1 042 billion per year in extra revenue the aim is it will go towards promoting and developing sports in schools if that true well we ll see how it plays out taxing parents doesn win an election the uk has set bar that believe other countries around the world will now follow and think that australia will be next the timing is perfect precedence has been set all scott morrison needs to do is just follow suit imagine if this rolls out worldwide in 2015 red bull sold 5 957 billion cans of red bull do the maths if every red bull had 20 cent tax added it would raise 1 19 billion and that just red bull add it to coke pepsi mountain dew monster and rockstar it would mean billions around the world in tax revenue think this sugar tax is all posturing it reeks of political vote grabbing when you boil it down sugar tax won really reduce the occurrence of obesity but it will take good decade or so to see that meanwhile it will raise billions for the government while making what looks like socially responsible move britvic plc lon bvic drinks maker plunged from 7 09 to 6 76 within 24 hours of the announcement g barr plc lon bag who make the popular irn bru is down over 6 since wednesday sure soft drinks are high in sugar but so is chocolate chips white bread pasta sauce tomato sauce cake fruit juice and whole range of other foods that are just as bad for kids the buck really stops with parents the best and only way to tackle childhood obesity is through parents you want to tax something to tackle obesity increase the income tax on parents with obese kids see how well that goes down with voters the sugar tax in the uk will stay it will continue to be vote grab with little substance you ll probably see it in australia and possibly other countries around the world it will cost soft drink companies big time companies like britvic g barr and coca cola amatil asx cca in australia with the uk setting things in motion now might be good time to think about exiting soft drink maker stocks this tax is another example of the government taking the easy road out it looks good on the surface but doesn tackle the real problem the real problem is poor choices but taking aim at irresponsible parents doesn win an election sugar
